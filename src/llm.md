# PR Bot in Action

TODO

Suppose we [__Submit a Pull Request__](TODO) to the NuttX Repo...

<div style="margin-left: 5%; width: 90%; font-size:90%">

__Summary__ <br>
_Document stack and backtrace dump for Espressif SoCs [...more...]_

__Impact__ <br>
_Fix backtrace dump on assertions considering assertions triggered by tasks or during an interrupt service._

__Testing__ <br>
_Internal CI testing with HW on all Xtensa-based devices [...more...]_

[(Thanks to __Tiago Medicci Serrano__)](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/pull/13546)

</div>

Our PR Review Bot will helpfully __Review the Pull Request__ and post a Review Comment...

<div style="margin-left: 5%; width: 90%; font-size:90%">

_This PR appears to meet the NuttX requirements. Here's a breakdown:_

__Summary:__

- __Clear explanation of the change:__ The summary clearly states the purpose of the change, addressing a fix for the backtrace dump functionality specifically for Espressif SoCs _[...more...]_
- __Issue references:__ While not explicitly mentioned, the summary implies addressing an existing issue with backtrace dumps on the mentioned architectures. It would be beneficial to add specific issue references if applicable.

__Impact:__

- __Feature change:__ This PR focuses on fixing an existing feature (backtrace dump), not introducing a new one _[...more...]_
- __Security impact:__ No security implications are mentioned.
- __Compatibility impact:__ No backward or forward compatibility issues are mentioned.

__Testing:__

- __Verification:__ The author confirms testing on local setup with positive results.
- __Host and Target:__ While "Internal CI testing" is mentioned, listing specific host OS, compiler versions, and target boards used for testing would strengthen the validation _[...more...]_

__Overall:__

This PR demonstrates a good understanding of NuttX requirements. Adding specific issue references and detailing the testing environment would further strengthen it.

[(See the __Review Comment__)](TODO)

Hopefully this will be helpful to __New Contributors__ to NuttX. And it might help the __PR Reviewers__ too.

How did this happen? We find out...

# Requirements for PR Review

_Our Bot gets really chatty and naggy. Why?_

That's because we programmed it with a __Long List of Requirements__ for PR Review, in Markdown Format: [main.rs](https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-pr-bot/blob/main/src/main.rs#L24-L66)

<div style="margin-left: 5%; width: 90%; font-size:90%">

```rust
/// Requirements for PR Review
const REQUIREMENTS: &str =
r#####"
# Here are the requirements for a NuttX PR

## Summary

* Why change is necessary (fix, update, new feature)?
* What functional part of the code is being changed?
* How does the change exactly work (what will change and how)?
* Related [NuttX Issue](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/issues) reference if applicable.
* Related NuttX Apps [Issue](https://github.com/apache/nuttx-apps/issues) / [Pull Request](https://github.com/apache/nuttx-apps/pulls) reference if applicable.

## Impact

* Is new feature added? Is existing feature changed?
* Impact on user (will user need to adapt to change)? NO / YES (please describe if yes).
* Impact on build (will build process change)? NO / YES (please descibe if yes).
* Impact on hardware (will arch(s) / board(s) / driver(s) change)? NO / YES (please describe if yes).
* Impact on documentation (is update required / provided)? NO / YES (please describe if yes).
* Impact on security (any sort of implications)? NO / YES (please describe if yes).
* Impact on compatibility (backward/forward/interoperability)? NO / YES (please describe if yes).
* Anything else to consider?

## Testing

I confirm that changes are verified on local setup and works as intended:
* Build Host(s): OS (Linux,BSD,macOS,Windows,..), CPU(Intel,AMD,ARM), compiler(GCC,CLANG,version), etc.
* Target(s): arch(sim,RISC-V,ARM,..), board:config, etc.

Testing logs after change: _your testing logs here_

[(Thanks to __Tomek Cedro__)](TODO)

</div>

_But these are Human-Readable Requirements?_

That's the beauty of an LLM: We feed it the __Human Text__, then the LLM gets it (hopefully) and does what we expect it to do!

It helps to __define our requirements precisely__, mark the boundaries clearly. Otherwise our LLM will wander off, and hallucinate strange new ways to validate our Pull Request.

[(Which happened in our last __LLM Experiment__)](TODO)

_How do we feed the PR Content to LLM?_

Our PR Requirements are in __Markdown Format__. Same for the PR Content.

Thus we meld them together into __One Long Markdown Doc__ and feed to LLM: [main.rs](https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-pr-bot/blob/main/src/main.rs#L212-L218)

```rust
// Compose the Prompt for LLM Request:
// PR Requirements + PR Body
let input = 
  REQUIREMENTS.to_string() +
  "\n\n# Does this PR meet the NuttX Requirements? Please be concise\n\n" +
  &body;
```

Which will look like this...

```text
# Here are the requirements for a NuttX PR
## Summary [...requirements...]
## Impact [...requirements...]
## Testing [...requirements...]

# Does this PR meet the NuttX Requirements? Please be concise
## Summary
Document stack and backtrace dump for Espressif SoCs [...more...]

## Impact
Fix backtrace dump on assertions considering assertions triggered by tasks or during an interrupt service.

## Testing
Internal CI testing with HW on all Xtensa-based devices [...more...]
```

_Why "please be concise"?_

Based on [__Community Feedback__](TODO), our Bot was getting way too chatty and naggy.

It's hard to control the LLM Output, hence we politely asked LLM to __tone down the response__. (And be a little less irritating)

Also we excluded the Bot from Pull Requests that are [__Extra Small__](TODO). (10 lines of code changes or fewer)

_Will our Bot get stuck in a loop? Forever replying to its own responses?_

Nope it won't. Our Bot will skip [__Pull Requests that have Comments__](TODO).

# Call the Gemini API
