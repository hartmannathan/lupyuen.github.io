# 64-bit RISC-V with Apache NuttX RTOS

üìù _1 Jul 2023_

[__Apache NuttX__](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html) is a __Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)__ that runs on many kinds of devices, from 8-bit to 64-bit.

(Think Linux, but a lot smaller and simpler)

In this article we'll...

-   Boot NuttX RTOS on a __64-bit RISC-V__ device

-   Explore the __Boot Code__ that starts NuttX on RISC-V

-   And learn a little __RISC-V Assembly__!

_But we need RISC-V Hardware?_

No worries! We'll run NuttX on the __QEMU Emulator__ for 64-bit RISC-V.

(Which will work on Linux, macOS and Windows machines)
