# Apache NuttX RTOS on RISC-V: Star64 JH7110 SBC

üìù _12 Jul 2023_

![Pine64 Star64 64-bit RISC-V SBC](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/nuttx2-title.jpg)

In this article we'll boot a tiny bit of [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/riscv) on the [__Pine64 Star64__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/STAR64) 64-bit RISC-V Single-Board Computer.

(Based on [__StarFive JH7110__](https://doc-en.rvspace.org/Doc_Center/jh7110.html) SoC)

_What's NuttX?_

[__Apache NuttX__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/riscv) is a __Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)__ that runs on many kinds of devices, from 8-bit to 64-bit.

_NuttX supports Star64?_

Nope NuttX won't run on Star64 yet, we'll hit some interesting (but highly educational) RISC-V issues.

The things that we learn today will be super helpful for [__porting NuttX to Star64__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/riscv#jump-to-start).

Please read on to find out how we're __booting a new OS__ (from scratch) on Star64 and JH7110...
