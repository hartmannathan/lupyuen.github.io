# Bisecting a Bug in Apache NuttX RTOS (Git Bisect)

üìù _31 Jan 2024_

![TODO](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bisect-title.jpg)

2 Weeks Ago: We spoke of a [__Runtime Bug__](TODO) in __Apache NuttX RTOS__. We think that the __Breaking Commit__ falls somewhere between these __"Good" and "Bad" Commits__...

| | |
|:------------|:---------|
| __Good Commit__ <br> _DD MMM YYYY_ | NuttX runs OK  <br> _1234abcd_ TODO
| __Bad Commit__ <br> _DD MMM YYYY_ | NuttX fails to run <br> _1234abcd_ TODO

That's [__TODO Commits__](TODO). Which is the Breaking Commit?

_We could Rewind Each Commit and test?_

We could rewind and retest TODO Commits for [__Compile Errors__](TODO). But it's probably too slow for __Runtime Errors__.

We have a quicker way: __Git Bisect__!

TODO

# Automated Bisect

_What's this Git Bisect?_

Remember [__Binary Chop__](TODO)?

> "I'm thinking of a number from 1 to TODO <br> To guess my number: <br> Ask me TODO yes-no questions"

[__Git Bisect__](TODO) works the same way, but for __Git Commits__...

- Our __Breaking Commit__ is one of ??? Commits

- Git Bisect shall __Pick the Middle Commit__ and ask: "Is this a Good Commit or Bad Commit?"

- Repeat until we discover the __Breaking Commit__

_Is it automated?_

Yep Git Bisect will gleefully seek the Breaking Commit on its own... Assuming that we provide a Script to __Assess the Goodness / Badness__ of a NuttX Commit...

TODO: Simple Script

[(Or do it manually)](TODO)

This is how we start Git Bisect...

TODO: Git Bisect Script

Let's study the outcome...

TODO: Pic of Simulated Git Bisect

# Simulate The Git Bisect

_What just happened in Git Bisect?_

- We told Git Bisect that Commit #`TODO` is Good and Commit #`TODO` is Bad

- Git Bisect picked the __Middle Commit__ #`TODO`

- And discovered that __Commit #`TODO` is TODO__ (via our script)

- Then it continued bisecting. Assessing Commit #`TODO` (TODO), #`TODO`(TODO), #`TODO` (TODO)...

- Finally deducing that Commit #`TODO` is the __Breaking Commit__

This works fine for our (randomised) __Simulated Git Bisect__. Now we do it for real...

# Continuous Integration Test

_Will Git Bisect work for Real-Life NuttX?_

From our [__Bug Report__](TODO): NuttX fails the __Continuous Integration Test__ (CI Test) for RISC-V QEMU.

TODO: CI Test Log

This happens inside the CI Job risc-v-TODO, which we can run with __Docker Engine__...

TODO: Run CI Test with Docker

Thus this becomes our Git Bisect Script (that assesses "Goodness" vs "Badness")

TODO: Git Bisect Script

We run this...

TODO: Pic of Git Bisect #1

# Git Bisect For Real

_What just happened in Git Bisect?_

- We told Git Bisect that Commit #`TODO` is Good and Commit #`TODO` is Bad

- Git Bisect picked the __Middle Commit__ #`TODO`

- And discovered that __Commit #`TODO` is TODO__ (via our script)

- Then it continued bisecting. Assessing Commit #`TODO` (TODO), #`TODO`(TODO), #`TODO` (TODO)...

- Finally deducing that Commit #`TODO` is the __Breaking Commit__

TODO

# Git Bisect Gets Quirky

_Did Git Bisect find the correct Breaking Commit?_

To be absolutely sure: We run Git Bisect __one more time__...

TODO

# TODO

Number the commits

Commit #`123`

Commit #`456`

Why Git Bisect? Because each test runs for 1 hour!

Assume will terminate in 1 hour! Actually terminates in 30 mins. Change this for your machine!

Press Ctrl-C very carefully, don't crash Docker!

How many commits between 14 Nov and 4 Dec?

Now that we can bisect reliably and automatically: Shall we do this for All Failed Builds?

NuttX Hash vs Apps Hash

But NuttX Commit might not compile with Apps Commit, must be compatible

Maybe return special exit code 125 if can't compile

Inconsistent CI Test?

Let it simmer overnight (probably 7 hours, like my Bean Stew)

Did git bisect find the breaking commit? 

Erm not quite.

Always run twice 

That's 2 bean stews!

# Bisect Run

https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect#_bisect_run

If you have a script that can tell if the current source code is good or bad, you can bisect by issuing the command:

$ git bisect run my_script arguments

Note that the script (my_script in the above example) should exit with code 0 if the current source code is good/old, and exit with a code between 1 and 127 (inclusive), except 125, if the current source code is bad/new.

Any other exit code will abort the bisect process. It should be noted that a program that terminates via exit(-1) leaves $? = 255, (see the exit(3) manual page), as the value is chopped with & 0377.

The special exit code 125 should be used when the current source code cannot be tested. If the script exits with this code, the current revision will be skipped (see git bisect skip above). 125 was chosen as the highest sensible value to use for this purpose, because 126 and 127 are used by POSIX shells to signal specific error status (127 is for command not found, 126 is for command found but not executable‚Äî‚Äãthese details do not matter, as they are normal errors in the script, as far as bisect run is concerned).

You may often find that during a bisect session you want to have temporary modifications (e.g. s/#define DEBUG 0/#define DEBUG 1/ in a header file, or "revision that does not have this commit needs this patch applied to work around another problem this bisection is not interested in") applied to the revision being tested.

To cope with such a situation, after the inner git bisect finds the next revision to test, the script can apply the patch before compiling, run the real test, and afterwards decide if the revision (possibly with the needed patch) passed the test and then rewind the tree to the pristine state. Finally the script should exit with the status of the real test to let the git bisect run command loop determine the eventual outcome of the bisect session.
