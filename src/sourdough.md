# Wholemeal Sourdough Starter

Daily routine for Sourdough Starter, assuming that we bake every other day...

-   Before Every Feeding: Pour away most of the Sourdough Starter. A tiny bit of Sourdough Starter is sufficient to chomp up the flour.

-   Feed 2 times daily:

    -   1/4 cup Superfine Wholegrain Flour [(Prima)](https://www.redmanshop.com/shop-by-category/baking-ingredients/flour/speciality-flour/000000000000103830.html)
    
    -   1/4 cup Boiled Water at Room Temperature. Consistency should be watery, so it's easier to pour away.

    Except for the morning of dough-making, increase to:

    -   3/4 cup Superfine Wholegrain Flour [(Prima)](https://www.redmanshop.com/shop-by-category/baking-ingredients/flour/speciality-flour/000000000000103830.html)
    
    -   1/4 cup Boiled Water at Room Temperature. Consistency should be like thick oatmeal, so it will rise better.

-   Stir the Sourdough Starter with a chopstick (the blunt end)

-   Every Other Afternoon / Evening: Sourdough Starter should double in height by afternoon / evening, ready for dough-making.

-   Wipe clean the inside of the Sourdough Jar whenever we discard Sourdough Starter

# Baking the Wholemeal Sourdough

Every other afternoon / evening we prepare the dough for a One-Pound Loaf of Honey & Milk Sourdough Bread. (Baked the next morning)

Add in this sequence to Bread Machine...

-   1 tablespoon (14g) Cold Unsalted Butter (from fridge)

-   1 tablespoon Honey

    [(Or 1 stick of Ovaltine Instant Malt Drink Powder, 30g)](https://www.fairprice.com.sg/product/ovaltine-malt-drink-chocolate-820g-13058372)

-   1 tablespoon Full Cream Milk Powder 

-   3/4 cup Boiling Water (100 deg C)

    Stir the Boiling Water to melt the butter and blend the honey (or Ovaltine) and milk.

-   1 cup Wholemeal Sourdough Starter, ripe (fed) from above

    (Just add all the Sourdough Starter, leaving a little bit to regenerate)

-   2 cups (240g) Bread Flour

-   1/2 teaspoon (2.8g) Salt

-   1/4 teaspoon Baking Soda / Sodium Bicarbonate (to neutralise the sourness and give extra poofiness).

    Too much Baking Soda will taste soapy!

We will knead the dough in the Bread Machine, move the Bread Bucket to a Cool Oven to rise the dough (3 hours), refrigerate overnight (slow rising), then move the Bread Bucket back to the Bread Machine for more rising and baking. Here are the steps...

1.  To knead the dough, start [Zojirushi Home Bakery Mini Breadmaker (BB-HAC10)](https://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/bbhac) with "Quick Baking" Cycle.

    (This is the quickest way to knead)

1.  If Necessary: Sprinkle Bread Flour or Water until dough becomes a Smooth and Creamy Ball. [(Pic above)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough25.jpg)

1.  After the Kneading Step has completed, power off the Bread Machine

1.  Remove the Paddle from the Bread Bucket. (Because otherwise the dough will rise, dislodge the Paddle, and Paddle gets stuck inside the bread)

    Here's how: Tilt the Bread Bucket to one side, scrape the dough off the Paddle with a wooden chopstick, remove the Paddle.

1.  Inside the Bread Bucket: Wet our hands and [Stretch and Fold](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/how-to-stretch-and-fold-sourdough-bread-dough/) the dough one round: North, South, East, West

    Seriously Stretch the dough with a Looooong Pull, before Each Folding. Makes the bread super floofy!

1.  Inside the Bread Bucket: Wet our hands and pat the dough until it becomes a Smooth and Creamy Ball. Scrape the dough away from the sides of the Bread Bucket.

    Smooth over any holes, make the dough airtight.

1.  Place the Bread Bucket in a Cool Oven, and cover with a Dry Towel. [(Pic above)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough25.jpg)

    Allow the dough to rise for 3 hours. The dough should reach almost the brim of the Bread Bucket.

1.  Refrigerate overnight the whole Bread Bucket (covered with Dry Towel) for slow rising, before baking the next day.

    (Not the freezer!)

1.  Next Morning: Start [Zojirushi Home Bakery Mini Breadmaker (BB-HAC10)](https://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/bbhac) with "French Bread" Cycle (5 hour cycle) WITHOUT the Bread Bucket.

    Bread Machine will try to knead without the Bread Bucket. And that's OK.

1.  35 mins after starting "French Bread" Cycle: Bread Machine will stop kneading.

    Move the Bread Bucket from fridge into the Bread Machine.

1.  "French Bread" Cycle will warm up and rise the dough for 3 hours.

    Then bake for 1.5 hours.

    [(French Bread Mode is explained on Page 17)](https://www.zojirushi.com/servicesupport/manuals/manual_pdf/bb_hac10.pdf)

1.  After Baking: Our loaf might get stuck to the Spindle in the Bread Bucket.

    Turn the Spindle a few rounds, via the Bottom Exterior of Bread Bucket. (Very hot!)

    Our loaf will plop out from the Bread Bucket. Don't shake the Bread Bucket too hard, because the loaf will tear with a circular hole.

Yep it's 8 hours plus fridge overnight 9 hours, instead of the normal 5-hour "French Bread" Mode! This gives the dough plenty of time to rise (12 hours), for the extra bubbly floofiness.

# Okinawa Black Sugar Sourdough

![Okinawa Black Sugar Sourdough](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough22.jpg)

Add in this sequence to Bread Machine...

-   3 cubes [Okinawa Black Sugar](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough23.jpg)

-   1 tablespoon (14g) Cold Unsalted Butter (from fridge)

-   4 tablespoons Boiling Water (100 deg C, to melt the sugar and butter)

-   2 ladles (2/3 cups) Wholemeal Sourdough Starter, ripe (fed) from above

-   1 cup (120g) [Brown Sugar Flour](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough24.jpg)

-   1/2 teaspoon (2.8g) Salt

-   1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda / Sodium Bicarbonate (to neutralise the sourness and give extra poofiness). Too much Baking Soda will taste soapy!

During Kneading...

-   Add 1/2 cup Raisins

-   Sprinkle a few teaspoons of [Superfine Wholegrain Flour](https://www.redmanshop.com/shop-by-category/baking-ingredients/flour/speciality-flour/000000000000103830.html) until it looks like a smooth bump

    (Dough will not become a Ball because it's too wet and frothy)

-   Bake according to the above "French Bread" Cycle
