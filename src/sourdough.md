__Warning:__ We're still tweaking the recipe below for Hot and Humid Singapore...

- Is it [__Overfermented__](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/Troubleshooting.html#overfermented)? Or [__pH Level__](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/Wheatsourdough.html#bulk-fermentation) too acidic? Let's get a [__Food pH Meter__](https://shp.ee/1rt7sae) and verify!

- Our Sourdough Dough should begin [__fermenting at pH 6.0__](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/Wheatsourdough.html#bulk-fermentation). Then shortly before baking it should have pH 4.0.

- We're still hacking the sourdough, __"be-new and improve"__ the recipe with a pH Meter

  (Normally we'll "debug" but Bugs and Food don't mix! And "troubleshoot" sounds a little... violent)

- My deepest apologies to the folks who taste and test all my awful sourdough creations. Luv you!

# Wholemeal Sourdough Starter

Daily routine for __Sourdough Starter__, assuming that we bake every other day...

![Wholemeal Sourdough Starter ready for baking](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough27.jpg)

-   __Before Every Feeding:__ Pour away most of the Sourdough Starter. A tiny bit of Sourdough Starter is sufficient to chomp up the flour.

-   __Feed 2 times daily:__

    -   1/2 cup __Superfine Wholegrain Flour__ [(Prima)](https://www.primaflour.com/product-description/primaflour-superfine-wholegrain-flour/)
    
    -   1/4 cup __Boiled Water__ at Room Temperature. Consistency should be like thick oatmeal, so it will rise better.

    Except for the __morning of dough-making__, increase to:

    -   3/4 cups __Superfine Wholegrain Flour__ [(Prima)](https://www.primaflour.com/product-description/primaflour-superfine-wholegrain-flour/)
    
    -   1/2 cup __Boiled Water__ at Room Temperature. Consistency should be like thick oatmeal, so it will rise better.

-   Stir the Sourdough Starter with a chopstick (the blunt end)

-   __Every Other Afternoon:__ Sourdough Starter should double in height by afternoon, ready for dough-making. (Pic above)

-   Wipe clean the inside of the Sourdough Jar whenever we discard Sourdough Starter

![Mix the dough](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough28.jpg)

# Mix the Dough

__Every Other After:__ we prepare the dough for a Half-Pound Loaf of Sourdough Bread.

Add in this sequence to Bread Bucket (pic above)...

-   1/2 cup __Boiled Water__ at Room Temperature

-   1 tablespoon (14g) __Cold Salted Butter__ (from fridge)

    Inside Bread Bucket: Crush Butter into small bits with a spoon.

-   1 stick (21g) [__Unisoy Soy Matcha Powder__](https://www.unisoy.com.sg/unisoy-gold-nutritious-soy-matcha)

-   1.5 cups __Bread Flour__ [(Prima)](https://www.primaflour.com/product-description/primaflour-bread-flour/)

-   All of the __Wholemeal Sourdough Starter__ (from above)

![Knead the dough](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough29.jpg)

_(TODO: Actually the dough is dryer, firmer, rounder than the pic above. Dryer dough is easier to manage, less risk of overfermentation)_

# Knead the Dough

We will __knead the dough__ in the Bread Machine, move the Bread Bucket to the Fridge and Cool Oven to __rise the dough__, cool overnight in Fridge, then move the Bread Bucket back to the Bread Machine for __more rising and baking__. Here are the steps...

1.  __To knead the dough:__ Start [Zojirushi Home Bakery Mini Breadmaker (BB-HAC10)](https://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/bbhac) with __"Quick Baking"__ Cycle.

    (Which is the quickest way to knead)

1.  Sprinkle Bread Flour or Water until dough becomes a __Smooth and Creamy Ball__. (Pic above)

1.  After the Kneading Step has completed, power off the Bread Machine

1.  __Remove the Paddle__ from the Bread Bucket. (Because otherwise the dough will rise, dislodge the Paddle, and Paddle gets stuck inside the bread)

    Here's how: Tilt the Bread Bucket to one side, scrape the dough off the Paddle with a wooden chopstick, remove the Paddle.

1.  Inside the Bread Bucket: With dry hands (dusted with Bread Flour), [__Stretch and Fold__](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/Wheatsourdough.html#stretch-and-folds) the dough one round: North, South, East, West

    (Be careful not to expel the gas!)

1.  Pat the dough and rotate the Bread Bucket, until it becomes a __Smooth and Creamy Lump__. Scrape the dough away from the sides of the Bread Bucket.

    Smooth over any holes, make the dough airtight. (Pic below)

![Stretch and fold the dough before rising](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough30.jpg)

_(TODO: Actually the dough is dryer, firmer, rounder than the pic above. Dryer dough is easier to manage, less risk of overfermentation)_

# Rise the Dough

1.  Place the Bread Bucket in the Fridge (not the freezer!), and cover with a Dry Towel. 

    Rest for 1 hour.

1.  Place the Bread Bucket in a Cool Oven, and cover with a Dry Towel. (Pic above)

    Rise for 1 hour.

1.  Inside the Bread Bucket: With dry hands (dusted with Bread Flour), [__Stretch and Fold__](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/Wheatsourdough.html#stretch-and-folds) the dough one round: North, South, East, West

    (Be careful not to expel the gas!)

1.  Pat the dough and rotate the Bread Bucket, until it becomes a __Smooth and Creamy Lump__. Scrape the dough away from the sides of the Bread Bucket.

    Smooth over any holes, make the dough airtight. (Pic below)

1.  Cool in Fridge for 1 hour, rise in Cool Oven for 1 hour, Stretch and Fold.

    Repeat this for a total of __4 times__.

1.  Chill the Bread Bucket in the __Fridge overnight__.

    We'll bake in the morning.

1.  Why alternate Fridge and Oven? In Hot and Humid Singapore: This seems to prevent our dough from getting [__Overfermented, Sour and Gummy__](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/Troubleshooting.html#overfermented))

![Bake the dough](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough36.jpg)

# Bake the Dough

On the Morning of Baking...

1.  Start [Zojirushi Home Bakery Mini Breadmaker (BB-HAC10)](https://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/bbhac) with __"French Bread"__ Cycle (5 hour cycle) WITHOUT the Bread Bucket.

    Bread Machine will try to knead without the Bread Bucket. And that's OK.

1.  __3 hours__ after starting "French Bread" Cycle: __Move the Bread Bucket__ from Fridge into the Bread Machine. (Pic above)

    Yes the dough will be cold, slightly frozen.

1.  "French Bread" Cycle will __warm up and rise__ the dough for 1/2 hour.

    Then "French Bread" Cycle will bake for 1.5 hours. (Pic above)

    [(French Bread Mode is explained on Page 17)](https://www.zojirushi.com/servicesupport/manuals/manual_pdf/bb_hac10.pdf)

1.  __After Baking:__ Our loaf might get stuck to the Spindle in the Bread Bucket.

    Turn the Spindle a few rounds, via the Bottom Exterior of Bread Bucket. (Very hot!)

    Our loaf will plop out from the Bread Bucket. Don't shake the Bread Bucket too hard, because the loaf will tear with a circular hole.

Yep it's __8 hours rising__ plus __1.5 hours baking__, instead of the normal 5-hour "French Bread" Mode! This gives the dough plenty of time to rise, for the extra bubbly floofiness.

But remember not to [__overferment__](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/Troubleshooting.html#overfermented)!

![Food pH Meter](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough34.jpg)

# pH and Temperature Readings

A [__Food pH Meter__](https://shp.ee/1rt7sae) is super helpful! (Pic above)

To prevent [__Overfermentation__](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/Troubleshooting.html#overfermented): We target to End the Fermentation at __pH 3.9__, while maintaining Temperature at __25 deg C__ ...

| Time | pH | degC | Comment |
|:----:|:--:|:----:|:--------|
| 630am | | | Prepare starter, cold day
| 230pm | 3.7 | 26.5 | Starter ready
| 300pm | 5.1 | 27.6 | After mixing dough
| 520pm | 4.8 | 27.1 | Stretch and fold
| 620pm | 4.5 | 26.9 | Stretch and fold
| 720pm | 4.2 | 28.1 | Stretch and fold
| 815pm | 4.0 | 28.5 | Stretch and fold
| 910pm | 3.9 | 27.7 | Stretch and fold
| 1000pm | | | Chill overnight in fridge

# Okinawa Black Sugar Sourdough

![Okinawa Black Sugar Sourdough](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough22.jpg)

Add in this sequence to Bread Machine...

-   3 cubes [Okinawa Black Sugar](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough23.jpg)

-   1 tablespoon (14g) Cold Unsalted Butter (from fridge)

-   4 tablespoons Boiling Water (100 deg C, to melt the sugar and butter)

-   2 ladles (2/3 cups) Wholemeal Sourdough Starter, ripe (fed) from above

-   1 cup (120g) [Brown Sugar Flour](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough24.jpg)

-   1/2 teaspoon (2.8g) Salt

-   1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda / Sodium Bicarbonate (to neutralise the sourness and give extra poofiness). Too much Baking Soda will taste soapy!

During Kneading...

-   Add 1/2 cup Raisins

-   Sprinkle a few teaspoons of [Superfine Wholegrain Flour](https://www.primaflour.com/product-description/primaflour-superfine-wholegrain-flour/) until it looks like a smooth bump

    (Dough will not become a Ball because it's too wet and frothy)

-   Bake according to the above "French Bread" Cycle
