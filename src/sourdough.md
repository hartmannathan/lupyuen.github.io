# Wholemeal Sourdough Starter

Daily routine for Sourdough Starter...

-   Every morning: Discard 3 ladles (2 cups) of Sourdough Starter.

    Place the discard at Bread Machine, ready for baking.
    
-   Feed 4 times daily:

    1/2 cup Extra Fine Wholemeal Flour [(Redman)](https://www.redmanshop.com/shop-by-category/baking-ingredients/flour/speciality-flour/000000000000067696.html)
    
    1/4 cup Boiled Water at Room Temperature

    Consistency should be like thick oatmeal. If it's too watery, skip the water.

-   Stir the Sourdough Starter with a chopstick (the blunt end) and keep cool in oven on metal rack.

    Place a [Freezer Pack](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Reusable-Hard-Sided-Rectangular/dp/B07YX8SBJK/ref=sxin_18_trfobq2a_1_B07YX8SBJK) (wrapped in Dish Towel) on the Oven Rack if too warm. (Especially in Sunny Singapore)
    
    Should see tiny bubbles in Sourdough Starter.

-   Sourdough Starter should double in size by next morning, ready for baking.

-   Wipe clean the inside of the Sourdough Jar whenever we discard Sourdough Starter in the morning.

# Baking the Wholemeal Sourdough

Every morning we bake a One-Pound Loaf of Sourdough Bread.

Add in this sequence to Bread Machine...

-   1 tablespoon (14g) Cold Unsalted Butter (from fridge)

-   4 tablespoons Boiling Water (100 deg C, to melt the butter)

-   1 2/3 cups (200g) Extra Fine Wholemeal Flour [(Redman)](https://www.redmanshop.com/shop-by-category/baking-ingredients/flour/speciality-flour/000000000000067696.html)

-   3 ladles (2 cups) Wholemeal Sourdough Starter, ripe (fed) from above.

    Don't scald the Sourdough Starter with the Boiling Water.

-   8 teaspoons Vital Wheat Gluten (to perk up the wholemeal flour)

-   2 teaspoons Granulated Sugar

-   1/2 teaspoon (2.8g) Salt

-   2 teaspoon Instant Dry Yeast [(Redman)](https://www.redmanshop.com/shop-by-category/baking-ingredients/baking-aids/yeast/000000000000012294.html)

-   1/3 teaspoon Baking Soda / Sodium Bicarbonate (to neutralise the sourness and give extra poofiness). Too much Baking Soda will taste soapy!

    Separate the Yeast and Baking Soda from the Wet Ingredients. Pile on the Vital Wheat Gluten + Sugar + Salt, dig a little hole, place the Yeast and Baking Soda inside the hole.

-   NO MILK because the loaf will look burnt

Start [Zojirushi Home Bakery Mini Breadmaker (BB-HAC10)](https://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/bbhac) with "French Bread" Mode.

"French Bread" Mode will run this cycle...

- Rest: 20 mins
- Knead: 14 to 19 mins
- First Rising: 61 mins
- Stir Down + Second Rising: 25 mins
- Stir Down + Third Rising: 90 to 95 mins
- Bake: 80 to 90 mins
- Total: 5 hours

[(Page 17)](https://www.zojirushi.com/servicesupport/manuals/manual_pdf/bb_hac10.pdf)

During Kneading:
-   Sprinkle Extra Fine Wholemeal Flour until dough becomes a Smooth Ball
-   But not too much flour. Dough Ball should look like a Fresh Egg Yolk: Skin is shiny, slightly wet, inside is foamy liquid.
-   Tap a chopstick on the Dough Ball. The dough shouldn't stick to the chopstick.
    [(See pic below)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough3.jpg)
-   (Optional) At 4 hours 30 mins remaining, add 1/2 cup of Raisins (separated) or Prunes (quartered). This will sweeten the sourdough. Sourdough Starter will uplift any Dried Fruit, amazing!
    [(See Raisin Sourdough below)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough7.jpg)
    [(And Prune Sourdough)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough9.jpg)

During First Rising:
-   Warning: Dough may overflow! Before it overflows, keeping poking the dough with a chopstick (the blunt end) until the dough deflates.
    [(See pic below)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough5.jpg)

Just Before Baking: (1 hour 35 mins remaining)
-   Score the dough, so the steam can escape
