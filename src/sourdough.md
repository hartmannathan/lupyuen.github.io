# Wholemeal Sourdough Starter

Daily routine for Sourdough Starter, assuming that we bake every other day...

-   Every Other Morning: Discard 2 ladles (2/3 cups) of Sourdough Starter.

    Place the discard at Bread Machine, ready for baking.
    
-   Feed 2 times daily:

    -   1/4 cup Superfine Wholegrain Flour [(Prima)](https://www.redmanshop.com/shop-by-category/baking-ingredients/flour/speciality-flour/000000000000103830.html)
    
    -   1/8 cup Boiled Water at Room Temperature

    Except for the night before baking, increase to:

    -   1/2 cup Superfine Wholegrain Flour [(Prima)](https://www.redmanshop.com/shop-by-category/baking-ingredients/flour/speciality-flour/000000000000103830.html)
    
    -   1/4 cup Boiled Water at Room Temperature

    After each feeding, consistency should be like thick oatmeal. If it's too watery, skip the water.

-   Stir the Sourdough Starter with a chopstick (the blunt end)

-   Every Other Morning: Sourdough Starter should rise 2 cm by morning, ready for baking.

-   Wipe clean the inside of the Sourdough Jar whenever we discard Sourdough Starter in the morning.

-   If Sourdough Starter has exceeded 4 cups in volume, throw away half of the Sourdough Starter

# Baking the Wholemeal Sourdough

Every other morning we bake a One-Pound Loaf of Honey & Milk Sourdough Bread.

Add in this sequence to Bread Machine...

-   1 tablespoon (14g) Cold Unsalted Butter (from fridge)

-   1 tablespoon Honey

-   1 tablespoon Full Cream Milk Powder 

-   2 cups Boiling Water (100 deg C)

    Stir the Boiling Water to melt the butter and blend the honey and milk.

-   1/2 cup Wholemeal Sourdough Starter, ripe (fed) from above

    (I mark out 1.5 cm of the above container with 13 cm diameter)

    (Too much starter will make the bread gummy)

-   2 cups (240g) Bread Flour

-   1/2 teaspoon (2.8g) Salt

-   1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda / Sodium Bicarbonate (to neutralise the sourness and give extra poofiness).

    Too much Baking Soda will taste soapy!

We will knead the dough in the Bread Machine, move the Bread Bucket to a Warm Oven to rise the dough (4 hours), then move the Bread Bucket back to the Bread Machine for more rising and baking. Here are the steps...

1.  To knead the dough, start [Zojirushi Home Bakery Mini Breadmaker (BB-HAC10)](https://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/bbhac) with "Quick Baking" Cycle.

    (This is the quickest way to knead)

1.  Sprinkle Bread Flour or Water until dough becomes a Smooth and Creamy Ball. [(Pic above)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough25.jpg)

1.  After the Kneading Step has completed, power off the Bread Machine

1.  Remove the Paddle from the Bread Bucket. (Because otherwise the dough will rise, dislodge the Paddle, and Paddle gets stuck inside the bread)

    Here's how: Tilt the Bread Bucket to one side, scrape the dough off the Paddle with a wooden chopstick, remove the Paddle.

1.  Place the Bread Bucket in a Warm Oven, and cover with a Dry Towel. [(Pic above)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough25.jpg)

    Allow the dough to rise for 4 hours. Or until the dough reaches the brim of the Bread Bucket.

    (Nowadays I leave my Bread Bucket overnight for 8 hours in my Microwave Oven. The dough deflates a little, but the bread gets fluffier)

1.  Start [Zojirushi Home Bakery Mini Breadmaker (BB-HAC10)](https://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/bbhac) with "French Bread" Cycle (5 hour cycle) WITHOUT the Bread Bucket.

    Bread Machine will try to knead without the Bread Bucket. And that's OK.

1.  35 mins after starting "French Bread" Cycle: Bread Machine will stop kneading.

    Move the Bread Bucket into the Bread Machine.

1.  "French Bread" Cycle will warm up and rise the dough for 3 hours.

    Then bake for 1.5 hours.

    [(French Bread Mode is explained on Page 17)](https://www.zojirushi.com/servicesupport/manuals/manual_pdf/bb_hac10.pdf)

1.  Just Before Baking: Score our dough lengthwise with a wet sewing thread. (In a sawing motion)

    Pop any large bubbles.

    (Otherwise our dough will pop and deflate during baking)

1.  After Baking: Our loaf might get stuck to the Spindle in the Bread Bucket.

    Turn the Spindle a few rounds, via the Bottom Exterior of Bread Bucket. (Very hot!)

    Our loaf will plop out from the Bread Bucket. Don't shake the Bread Bucket too hard, because the loaf will tear with a circular hole.

Yep it's 9 hours in total, instead of the normal 5-hour "French Bread" Mode! This gives the sourdough plenty of time to rise (7.5 hours), for the extra bubbly floofiness.

How warm is the oven? For breakfast I toast my bread in the oven at 250 deg C for 5 minutes. I wait for the oven to cool a bit, then I move the Bread Bucket inside.

# Okinawa Black Sugar Sourdough

![Okinawa Black Sugar Sourdough](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough22.jpg)

Add in this sequence to Bread Machine...

-   3 cubes [Okinawa Black Sugar](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough23.jpg)

-   1 tablespoon (14g) Cold Unsalted Butter (from fridge)

-   4 tablespoons Boiling Water (100 deg C, to melt the sugar and butter)

-   2 ladles (2/3 cups) Wholemeal Sourdough Starter, ripe (fed) from above

-   1 cup (120g) [Brown Sugar Flour](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough24.jpg)

-   1/2 teaspoon (2.8g) Salt

-   1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda / Sodium Bicarbonate (to neutralise the sourness and give extra poofiness). Too much Baking Soda will taste soapy!

-   NO MILK because the loaf will look burnt

During Kneading...

-   Add 1/2 cup Raisins

-   Sprinkle a few teaspoons of [Superfine Wholegrain Flour](https://www.redmanshop.com/shop-by-category/baking-ingredients/flour/speciality-flour/000000000000103830.html) until it looks like a smooth bump

    (Dough will not become a Ball because it's too wet and frothy)

-   Bake according to the above "French Bread" Cycle
