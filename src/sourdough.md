# Wholemeal Sourdough Starter

Daily routine for __Sourdough Starter__, assuming that we bake every other day...

![Wholemeal Sourdough Starter ready for baking](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough27.jpg)

-   __Before Every Feeding:__ Pour away most of the Sourdough Starter. A tiny bit of Sourdough Starter is sufficient to chomp up the flour.

-   __Feed 2 times daily:__

    -   1 cup __Superfine Wholegrain Flour__ [(Prima)](https://www.primaflour.com/product-description/primaflour-superfine-wholegrain-flour/)
    
    -   1/4 cup __Boiled Water__ at Room Temperature. Consistency should be like thick oatmeal, so it will rise better.

    Except for the __night before dough-making__, increase to:

    -   2 cups __Superfine Wholegrain Flour__ [(Prima)](https://www.primaflour.com/product-description/primaflour-superfine-wholegrain-flour/)
    
    -   1/2 cup __Boiled Water__ at Room Temperature. Consistency should be like thick oatmeal, so it will rise better.

-   Stir the Sourdough Starter with a chopstick (the blunt end)

-   __Every Other Morning:__ Sourdough Starter should double in height by morning, ready for dough-making. (Pic above)

    Use 2 Rubber Bands to Halve the Starter. (Pic above)

-   Wipe clean the inside of the Sourdough Jar whenever we discard Sourdough Starter

![Mix the dough](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough28.jpg)

# Mix the Dough

__Every Other Morning:__ we prepare the dough for a One-Pound Loaf of Sourdough Bread.

Add in this sequence to Bread Machine (pic above)...

-   1 tablespoon (14g) __Cold Unsalted Butter__ (from fridge)

-   1 cup __Boiled Water__ at Room Temperature

-   1/4 cup (60g) __Superfine Wholegrain Flour__ [(Prima)](https://www.primaflour.com/product-description/primaflour-superfine-wholegrain-flour/)

-   2 cups (240g) __Bread Flour__ [(Prima)](https://www.primaflour.com/product-description/primaflour-bread-flour/)

-   1/2 teaspoon (2.8g) __Salt__

-   1/2 teaspoon __Baking Soda__ (to neutralise the sourness and give extra poofiness)

    (Too much Baking Soda will taste soapy!)

-   1/2 of the __Wholemeal Sourdough Starter__, ripe (fed) from above

    (Use 2 Rubber Bands to Halve the Starter)

![Knead the dough](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough29.jpg)

# Knead the Dough

We will __knead the dough__ in the Bread Machine, move the Bread Bucket to a Cool Oven to __rise the dough__ (4.5 hours), then move the Bread Bucket back to the Bread Machine for __more rising and baking__. Here are the steps...

1.  __To knead the dough:__ Start [Zojirushi Home Bakery Mini Breadmaker (BB-HAC10)](https://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/bbhac) with __"Quick Baking"__ Cycle.

    (Which is the quickest way to knead)

1.  Sprinkle Bread Flour or Water until dough becomes a __Smooth and Creamy Ball__. (Pic above)

1.  After the Kneading Step has completed, power off the Bread Machine

1.  __Remove the Paddle__ from the Bread Bucket. (Because otherwise the dough will rise, dislodge the Paddle, and Paddle gets stuck inside the bread)

    Here's how: Tilt the Bread Bucket to one side, scrape the dough off the Paddle with a wooden chopstick, remove the Paddle.

1.  Inside the Bread Bucket: With dry hands, [__Stretch and Fold__](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/Wheatsourdough.html#stretch-and-folds) the dough one round: North, South, East, West

    (Be careful not to expel the gas!)

1.  Pat the dough and rotate the Bread Bucket, until it becomes a __Smooth and Creamy Lump__. Scrape the dough away from the sides of the Bread Bucket.

    Smooth over any holes, make the dough airtight. (Pic below)

![Stretch and fold the dough before rising](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough30.jpg)

# Rise the Dough

1.  Place the Bread Bucket in a Cool Oven, and cover with a Dry Towel. (Pic above)

    Allow the dough to rise for __2 hours__. The dough should reach __Half the Depth__ of the Bread Bucket. (Pic below)

1.  Inside the Bread Bucket: With dry hands, [__Stretch and Fold__](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/Wheatsourdough.html#stretch-and-folds) the dough one round: North, South, East, West

    (Be careful not to expel the gas!)

1.  Pat the dough and rotate the Bread Bucket, until it becomes a __Smooth and Creamy Lump__. Scrape the dough away from the sides of the Bread Bucket.

    Smooth over any holes, make the dough airtight. (Pic below)

1.  __Stop the Fermentation:__ Place Ice Packs inside the oven to stop the fermentation. (Pic below)

    (Otherwise dough will become [__Overfermented, Sour and Gummy__](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/Troubleshooting.html#overfermented))

![Stretch and fold the dough while rising](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough31.jpg)

# Bake the Dough

1.  Start [Zojirushi Home Bakery Mini Breadmaker (BB-HAC10)](https://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/bbhac) with __"French Bread"__ Cycle (5 hour cycle) WITHOUT the Bread Bucket.

    Bread Machine will try to knead without the Bread Bucket. And that's OK.

1.  __1 hour__ after starting "French Bread" Cycle: __Stretch and fold__ like earlier. Pat and rotate the dough. Return to Cool Oven with Ice Packs.

    (Notice the big bubbles)

    ![Stretch and fold the dough one last time](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough32.jpg)

1.  __2.5 hours__ after starting "French Bread" Cycle: __Move the Bread Bucket__ from Oven into the Bread Machine. (Pic below)

1.  "French Bread" Cycle will __warm up and rise__ the dough for 1 hour. (Reaching the Notches in the Bread Bucket, pic below)

    Then "French Bread" Cycle will bake for 1.5 hours. (Pic below)

    [(French Bread Mode is explained on Page 17)](https://www.zojirushi.com/servicesupport/manuals/manual_pdf/bb_hac10.pdf)

1.  __After Baking:__ Our loaf might get stuck to the Spindle in the Bread Bucket.

    Turn the Spindle a few rounds, via the Bottom Exterior of Bread Bucket. (Very hot!)

    Our loaf will plop out from the Bread Bucket. Don't shake the Bread Bucket too hard, because the loaf will tear with a circular hole.

Yep it's __5.5 hours rising__ plus __1.5 hours baking__, instead of the normal 5-hour "French Bread" Mode! This gives the dough plenty of time to rise, for the extra bubbly floofiness.

But remember not to [__overferment__](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/Troubleshooting.html#overfermented)!

# Okinawa Black Sugar Sourdough

![Okinawa Black Sugar Sourdough](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough22.jpg)

Add in this sequence to Bread Machine...

-   3 cubes [Okinawa Black Sugar](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough23.jpg)

-   1 tablespoon (14g) Cold Unsalted Butter (from fridge)

-   4 tablespoons Boiling Water (100 deg C, to melt the sugar and butter)

-   2 ladles (2/3 cups) Wholemeal Sourdough Starter, ripe (fed) from above

-   1 cup (120g) [Brown Sugar Flour](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough24.jpg)

-   1/2 teaspoon (2.8g) Salt

-   1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda / Sodium Bicarbonate (to neutralise the sourness and give extra poofiness). Too much Baking Soda will taste soapy!

During Kneading...

-   Add 1/2 cup Raisins

-   Sprinkle a few teaspoons of [Superfine Wholegrain Flour](https://www.primaflour.com/product-description/primaflour-superfine-wholegrain-flour/) until it looks like a smooth bump

    (Dough will not become a Ball because it's too wet and frothy)

-   Bake according to the above "French Bread" Cycle
