# Wholemeal Sourdough Starter

Daily routine for Sourdough Starter, assuming that we bake every other day...

-   Every Other Morning: Discard 2 ladles (2/3 cups) of Sourdough Starter.

    Place the discard at Bread Machine, ready for baking.
    
-   Feed 2 times daily:

    -   1/2 cup Superfine Wholegrain Flour [(Prima)](https://www.redmanshop.com/shop-by-category/baking-ingredients/flour/speciality-flour/000000000000103830.html)
    
    -   1/4 cup Boiled Water at Room Temperature

    Except for the night before baking, increase to:

    -   1 cup Superfine Wholegrain Flour [(Prima)](https://www.redmanshop.com/shop-by-category/baking-ingredients/flour/speciality-flour/000000000000103830.html)
    
    -   1/2 cup Boiled Water at Room Temperature

    After each feeding, consistency should be like thick oatmeal. If it's too watery, skip the water.

-   Stir the Sourdough Starter with a chopstick (the blunt end)

-   Every Other Morning: Sourdough Starter should double in size by morning, ready for baking.

-   Wipe clean the inside of the Sourdough Jar whenever we discard Sourdough Starter in the morning.

# Baking the Wholemeal Sourdough

Every other morning we bake a One-Pound Loaf of Sourdough Bread.

Add in this sequence to Bread Machine...

-   1 tablespoon (14g) Cold Unsalted Butter (from fridge)

-   2 teaspoons Granulated Sugar

    (Or 3 cubes [Okinawa Black Sugar](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough23.jpg))

-   4 tablespoons Boiling Water (100 deg C, to melt the butter and sugar)

-   2 ladles (2/3 cups) Wholemeal Sourdough Starter, ripe (fed) from above

-   1 cup (120g) Bread Flour

-   1/2 teaspoon (2.8g) Salt

-   1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda / Sodium Bicarbonate (to neutralise the sourness and give extra poofiness). Too much Baking Soda will taste soapy!

-   NO MILK because the loaf will look burnt

Start [Zojirushi Home Bakery Mini Breadmaker (BB-HAC10)](https://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/bbhac) with "French Bread" Mode.

"French Bread" Mode will run this cycle...

- Rest: 20 mins
- Knead: 14 to 19 mins
- First Rising: 61 mins
- Stir Down + Second Rising: 25 mins
- Stir Down + Third Rising: 90 to 95 mins
- Bake: 80 to 90 mins
- Total: 5 hours

[(Page 17)](https://www.zojirushi.com/servicesupport/manuals/manual_pdf/bb_hac10.pdf)

During Kneading:

-   Sprinkle a few teaspoons of [Superfine Wholegrain Flour](https://www.redmanshop.com/shop-by-category/baking-ingredients/flour/speciality-flour/000000000000103830.html) until dough becomes a Smooth Ball

-   But not too much flour. Dough Ball should look like a Fresh Egg Yolk: Skin is shiny, slightly wet, inside is foamy liquid.

-   Tap a chopstick on the Dough Ball. The dough shouldn't stick to the chopstick.

    [(See pic below)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sourdough3.jpg)

-   (Optional) At 4 hours 30 mins remaining, add 1/2 cup of Raisins (separated) or Prunes (quartered). This will sweeten the sourdough. Sourdough Starter will uplift any Dried Fruit, amazing!
