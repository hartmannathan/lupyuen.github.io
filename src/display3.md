Today we look deep inside the __Display Controller__ of the [__RISC-V StarFive JH7110 SoC__](https://doc-en.rvspace.org/Doc_Center/jh7110.html) and figure out how it works.

_Why are we doing this?_

We're building a __HDMI Display Driver__ for [__Apache NuttX Real-Time Operating System__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/release) (RTOS) on the [__Pine64 Star64__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/STAR64) SBC. (Based on JH7110, just like VisionFive2)

Our analysis today will be super useful for creating our __HDMI Driver for NuttX__ on Star64. (Pic below)

And hopefully this article will be helpful for __porting other Operating Systems__ to JH7110!
