Testing a new Operating System like [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html) (or Linux) can get _painfully tedious_ on a Single-Board Computer...

Swapping, reflashing and rebooting a MicroSD Card, again and again and again!

[(Like how we tested __NuttX on PinePhone__)](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-nuttx)

Thankfully there's a better way: Booting NuttX (or Linux) over the __Local Network__, with __U-Boot Bootloader__ and __TFTP__!

Today we'll configure TFTP Network Boot on [__Pine64 Star64__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/STAR64) 64-bit RISC-V Single-Board Computer.
