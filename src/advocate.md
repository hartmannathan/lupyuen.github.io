_Typical day for this Open Source Advocate... Photoshoot for PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board_

üìù _15 Dec 2020_

2020 has been... A very challenging year!

Over the past year I've been an [Open Source Advocate](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/my-first-week-as-embedded-foss-advocate) for Embedded and IoT. Mostly on PineTime, PinePhone, Pinebook Pro and now PineCone. (Plus a tiny slice of pie... the Raspberry kind)

I've made a couple of mistakes... But I shall improve! Here's how...

# Be Kinder

Immersing myself into the Matrix / Discord / Telegram / IRC community was... Whoa! Overwhelming.

There were times when I got impatient and barked (like an angry chinchilla)... Not realising that people among us come from various places, age groups, and have different perspectives.

I'm sorry if I have hurt you or offended you online. I promise to be kinder the next time I connect to the online community.

# Focus on Education

2020 was an incredible year for PineTime. I ported the MCUBoot Bootloader to PineTime. And the bootloader was shipped to real customers.

But maintaining the bootloader for a shipping gadget is a serious Operational Job. And it clashes with my original objective: Teach IoT with PineTime

Sadly I have to drop my Operational Duties on PineTime... And bring my focus back to Education.

I'm happy to be starting from scratch with PineCone... RISC-V is a Really Good Thing and I'm doing all I can to bring everyone onboard!

# Keep on Writing and Committing

2020 was a great year for writing and coding. I published 28 articles on all kinds of topics... And I'm super delighted that you read them!

I'll stick with the same plan for 2021... Publish an article (with code) every 2 weeks.

Expect more photos, sketches and terrible puns. Maybe a silly story too!

Why? Because it's really tough to get mindshare for Open Source projects. And I'll do my best!

# Timezone

This one is tricky... I realise that I'm in the wrong timezone (Singapore). 

Whenever I hang out in Matrix / Discord / Telegram / IRC, most of the interesting discussions happen between 10pm and 6am (Singapore time).

Shall I change my sleep cycle?

Or join a community that has more people in my timezone? (Probably Asia + Australia + New Zealand)

Until I solve this problem, I'll have to stick with asynchronous, non-realtime comms with the Open Source community. Sorry! üôè

_My GitHub History_

# Stay Healthy

In September 2020 I started taking medication for Hypertension (Super High Blood Pressure).

Then life became soooo slooooooow. ("Time Goes By... So Slowly...")

I couldn't write or code as quickly as before. I had to drop my projects, and do only one tiny project at a time.

(You can see the huge gap around September in my GitHub History above)

I still don't feel fully productive right now. Hopefully my health will improve in 2021.

# What's Next

2020 was full of surprises... Can't wait to see what happens in 2021 üòâ

I must thank [My Sponsors](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/sponsor) for supporting my Open Source work. It's great to know that my Open Source work is helping people in the real world... And I shall definitely do better üôÇ

Happy Holidays Everyone! Stay Healthy, Have A Great 2021! üòÄ
