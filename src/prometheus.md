# Monitor IoT Devices in The Things Network with Prometheus and Grafana

📝 _21 Oct 2021_

Suppose we have some __IoT Devices__ that transmit __Sensor Data__ (via LoRa and LoRaWAN) to __The Things Network__...

[(That's the free-to-use public global wireless network for IoT Devices)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/ttn)

> ![IoT Devices transmitting Sensor Data to The Things Network](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/grafana-flow3.jpg)

_How shall we monitor the Sensor Data transmitted by the IoT Devices?_

Today we shall monitor IoT Sensor Data by connecting open source __Prometheus and Grafana__ to The Things Network...

![Monitoring IoT Devices in The Things Network with Prometheus and Grafana](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-title.jpg)

1.  __The Things Network__ pushes our __Sensor Data over MQTT__ in real time

1.  Our __MQTT Gateway__ consumes the Sensor Data...

1.  And publishes the Sensor Data to our __Prometheus Time Series Database__...

1.  Which gets rendered as a __Grafana Dashboard__ like this...

![Monitoring Devices on The Things Network with Prometheus and Grafana](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-grafana4.png)

_Why Prometheus and Grafana?_

Prometheus works great for __storing and querying__ IoT Sensor Data.

And Grafana works well with Prometheus for __visualising IoT Sensor Data__.

![PineDio Stack BL604 RISC-V Board (foreground) talking to The Things Network via RAKWireless RAK7248 LoRaWAN Gateway (background)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/ttn-title.jpg)

In a while we shall demo this Prometheus + Grafana Setup with __PineDio Stack BL604 RISC-V Board__ (pic above)

-   [__"The Things Network on PineDio Stack BL604 RISC-V Board"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/ttn)

But it should work for __any LoRaWAN Device__ connected to The Things Network... Assuming that we have configured a suitable __Payload Formatter__ in The Things Network. 

(Read on to learn how)

![CBOR Payload Formatter for The Things Network](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/payload-title.jpg)

# Payload Formatter

_What's a Payload Formatter in The Things Network?_

A __Payload Formatter__ is JavaScript Code that we configure in The Things Network to __decode the Sensor Data__ in the LoRaWAN Message Payload.

For PineDio Stack our Sensor Data is encoded with CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation), so we use this __CBOR Payload Formatter__...

-   [__"CBOR Payload Formatter for The Things Network"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/payload)

_Is it mandatory to use a Payload Formatter?_

Yes, our MQTT Gateway will work only if we __configure a suitable Payload Formatter__ that will decode our Sensor Data.

[(More about Payload Formatters)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/payload#whats-a-payload-formatter)

_What if we can't find a suitable Payload Formatter?_

We can make one together! [Post a comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheThingsNetwork/comments/qafzu4/cbor_payload_formatter_for_the_things_network/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

## Checkpoint Alpha

Let's verify that our __Payload Formatter works OK__ for decoding our Sensor Data...

1.  Start the __LoRaWAN Firmware__ on our LoRaWAN Device (PineDio Stack).

    Transmit some Sensor Data every minute...

    [__"Run the LoRaWAN Firmware"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/tsen#run-the-lorawan-firmware)

1.  Log on to __The Things Network Console__

1.  Click __Applications → (Your Application) → Live Data__

1.  Our __Decoded Sensor Data__ should appear in the Live Data Table like so...

    ```json
    Payload: { l: 4000, t: 4669 }
    ```

    ![Decoded Sensor Data in the Live Data Table](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/payload-ttn3.png)

1.  Click on a message in the __Live Data Table__. 

    We should see the __decoded_payload__ field containing our Decoded Sensor Data...

    ```json
    {
      ...
      "uplink_message": {
        ...
        "decoded_payload": {
          "l": 4000,
          "t": 4656
        }    
    ```

    These are the __Light Sensor__ ("`l`") and __Temperature Sensor__ ("`t`") values transmitted by our LoRaWAN Device (PineDio Stack).

    [(Our Temperature Values are scaled up 100 times... `4656` means `46.56` ºC)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/cbor#floating-point-numbers)

Also verify that the __MQTT Server works OK__ at The Things Network...

1.  Start our __LoRaWAN Firmware__ and transmit Sensor Data every minute

    [(Like this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/tsen#run-the-lorawan-firmware)

1.  Copy the __MQTT Public Address, Username and Password__ from The Things Network...

    [__"Configure The Things Network MQTT"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/prometheus#appendix-configure-the-things-network-mqtt)

1.  Install the __command-line tools for MQTT__...

    [__"Download Eclipse Mosquitto"__](https://mosquitto.org/download/)

1.  Enter this at the command line...

    ```bash
    ## Change au1.cloud.thethings.network to our 
    ## MQTT Public Address (without the port number)
    ## Change YOUR_USERNAME to our MQTT Username
    ## Change YOUR_PASSWORD to our MQTT Password

    ## For Linux and macOS:
    mosquitto_sub \
      -h au1.cloud.thethings.network \
      -t "#" \
      -u "YOUR_USERNAME" \
      -P "YOUR_PASSWORD" \
      -d

    ## For Windows:
    "c:\Program Files\Mosquitto\mosquitto_sub" ^
      -h au1.cloud.thethings.network ^
      -t "#" ^
      -u "YOUR_USERNAME" ^
      -P "YOUR_PASSWORD" ^
      -d
    ```

1.  We should see the __Uplink Messages transmitted__ by our LoRaWAN Device...

    ```json
    {
      ...
      "uplink_message": {
        ...
        "decoded_payload": {
          "l": 4000,
          "t": 4656
        }    
    ```

    Including __decoded_payload__ and the Decoded Sensor Data.

    [(See the complete message)](https://github.com/lupyuen/cbor-the-things-network#mqtt-log)

![MQTT Gateway for Prometheus](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-flow2.jpg)

# MQTT Gateway for Prometheus

Now we connect our MQTT Gateway to The Things Network...

-   [__MQTT2Prometheus MQTT Gateway__](https://github.com/hikhvar/mqtt2prometheus)

Our MQTT Gateway shall...

-   __Subscribe to all MQTT Topics__ published on The Things Network

    (Including the Uplink Messages transmitted by our device)

-   __Ingest the Decoded Sensor Data__ from the Uplink Messages

    (As Prometheus Metrics)

Follow these steps to __configure our MQTT Gateway__...

1.  Download the __MQTT Gateway Configuration File__...

    [__ttn-mqtt.yaml__](https://github.com/lupyuen/prometheus-the-things-network/blob/main/ttn-mqtt.yaml)

1.  Edit the file. Fill in the __MQTT Public Address, Username and Password__ for The Things Network [(from here)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/prometheus#appendix-configure-the-things-network-mqtt)...

    ```yaml    
    ## Change au1.cloud.thethings.network to our MQTT Public Address
    server: tcp://au1.cloud.thethings.network:1883

    ## Change luppy-application@ttn to our MQTT Username
    user: luppy-application@ttn

    ## Change YOUR_API_KEY to our MQTT Password
    password: YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

1.  Note that we're subscribing to __all MQTT Topics__...

    ```yaml
    ## Topic path to subscribe to. "#" means All Topics.
    topic_path: "#"
    ```

1.  Our MQTT Gateway shall extract the __Device ID__ from the MQTT Topic Path...

    ```yaml
    ## Extract the device ID (eui-YOUR_DEVICE_EUI) 
    ## from the topic path, which looks like...
    ## v3/luppy-application@ttn/devices/eui-YOUR_DEVICE_EUI/up
    device_id_regex: "(.*/)?devices/(?P<deviceid>.*)/.*"
    ```

    (Which will be helpful for filtering our Sensor Data by Device ID in Grafana)

    ![MQTT Configuration File](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-config4.png)

## Prometheus Metrics

_What's a Prometheus Metric?_

A Metric is an item of __Monitoring Data__ that's collected and reported by Prometheus.

(Think of Metrics like CPU Usage and RAM Utilisation... Prometheus was originally created for monitoring servers)

In this article we shall use "Sensor Data" and "Metric" interchangeably, since Prometheus treats our __Sensor Data as Metrics__.

Let's define the Sensor Data / Metrics that will be __ingested by our MQTT Gateway__...

1.  Edit [__ttn-mqtt.yaml__](https://github.com/lupyuen/prometheus-the-things-network/blob/main/ttn-mqtt.yaml)

    Look for the __metrics__ section...

    ![Prometheus Metrics for MQTT Gateway](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-config5.png)

1.  We define the __Metric for Temperature__ like so...

    ```yaml
    ## Temperature Metric
    ## Name of the metric in prometheus
    - prom_name: t

      ## JSON Path of the metric in our MQTT JSON message
      mqtt_name: "uplink_message.decoded_payload.t"

      ## Prometheus help text for this metric
      help: "Temperature"

      ## Prometheus type for this metric.
      ## Valid values are: "gauge" and "counter"
      type: gauge

      ## Map of string to string for constant labels.
      ## The labels will be attached to every Prometheus metric.
      const_labels:
        sensor_type: t    
    ```

1.  This tells MQTT Gateway: Our LoRaWAN Device (PineDio Stack) transmits a __Temperature Value__ (named "t") at this JSON Path...

    ```javascript
    uplink_message.decoded_payload.t
    ```

    Which matches our __JSON Message Format__ from Checkpoint Alpha...

    ```json
    {
      ...
      "uplink_message": {
        ...
        "decoded_payload": {
          "l": 4000,
          "t": 4656
        }    
    ```

    [(Our Temperature Values are scaled up 100 times... `4656` means `46.56` ºC)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/cbor#floating-point-numbers)

    ![Prometheus Metrics for MQTT Gateway](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-config7.jpg)

1.  We define other Metrics the same way, like this __Light Level Metric__ that's transmitted by PineDio Stack...

    ```yaml
    ## Light Level Metric
    ## Name of the metric in prometheus
    - prom_name: l

      ## JSON Path of the metric in our MQTT JSON message
      mqtt_name: "uplink_message.decoded_payload.l"

      ## Prometheus help text for this metric
      help: "Light Level"

      ## Prometheus type for this metric.
      ## Valid values are: "gauge" and "counter"
      type: gauge

      ## Map of string to string for constant labels.
      ## The labels will be attached to every Prometheus metric.
      const_labels:
        sensor_type: l
    ```

## Start MQTT Gateway

We're ready to __start our MQTT Gateway__!

Follow these steps to download and run __MQTT2Prometheus__...

1.  Install the __latest version of Go__...

    [__`golang.org`__](https://golang.org)

1.  Enter this at the command line...

    ```bash
    ## Download mqtt2prometheus
    go get github.com/hikhvar/mqtt2prometheus

    ## For Linux and macOS:
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hikhvar/mqtt2prometheus

    ## For Windows:
    cd %GOPATH%\src\github.com\hikhvar\mqtt2prometheus

    ## Build mqtt2prometheus
    go build ./cmd

    ## Run mqtt2prometheus.
    ## Change "ttn-mqtt.yaml" to the full path of our
    ## MQTT Gateway Configuration File.
    go run ./cmd -log-level debug -config ttn-mqtt.yaml
    ```

1.  For Windows: Click __"Private Network: Allow Access"__ when prompted

    (That's because our MQTT Gateway starts a HTTP Server at port 9641)

1.  We should see our MQTT Gateway __ingesting Sensor Data__ from The Things Network...

    ```text
    mqttclient/mqttClient.go:20     
    Connected to MQTT Broker

    mqttclient/mqttClient.go:21     
    Will subscribe to topic "#"

    web/tls_config.go:191           
    "TLS is disabled.", "http2": false

    metrics/ingest.go:42    
    Got message     
    "topic": "v3/luppy-application@ttn/devices/eui-YOUR_DEVICE_EUI/up", "payload": 
    {
      ...
      "uplink_message": {
        "decoded_payload": {
          "l": 4000,
          "t": 5017
        }
    ```

1.  MQTT Gateway is now listening for __HTTP Requests at port 9641__!

## Checkpoint Bravo

Let's check the __Sensor Data ingested__ by our MQTT Gateway...

1.  Start our __LoRaWAN Firmware__ and transmit Sensor Data every minute

    [(Like this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/tsen#run-the-lorawan-firmware)

1.  Enter this at the command-line...

    ```bash
    curl -v http://localhost:9641/metrics
    ```

1.  We should see our Sensor Data (Temperature and Light Level) ingested as __Prometheus Metrics__...

    ```text
    ## HELP l Light Level
    ## TYPE l gauge
    l{sensor="eui-YOUR_DEVICE_EUI",
    sensor_type="l",
    topic="v3/luppy-application@ttn/devices/eui-YOUR_DEVICE_EUI/up"
    } 4000 1634364863274
    ...    

    ## HELP t Temperature
    ## TYPE t gauge
    t{sensor="eui-YOUR_DEVICE_EUI",
    sensor_type="t",
    topic="v3/luppy-application@ttn/devices/eui-YOUR_DEVICE_EUI/up"
    } 5056 1634364863274
    ```

    This says that the Light Level is `4000` and the Temperature is `50.56` ºC, recorded at the Timestamp of `1634364863274`.

1.  Also watch for __received_messages__...

    ```text
    ## HELP received_messages received messages per topic and status
    ## TYPE received_messages counter
    received_messages{status="success",
    topic="v3/luppy-application@ttn/devices/eui-YOUR_DEVICE_EUI/up"
    } 3
    ```

    This says that our MQTT Gateway has successfully processed 3 messages from The Things Network.

    Let's move on to Prometheus...

    ![Prometheus Time Series Database](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-flow3.jpg)

# Prometheus Time Series Database

_How do we push the Sensor Data / Metrics from MQTT Gateway to Prometheus?_

Prometheus collects Metrics by __scraping them over HTTP__...

(Much like the __curl__ command from Checkpoint Bravo)

And stores the Metrics in its __Time Series Database__.

(Which is super efficient for querying sensor values that vary over time)

Let's __configure and start Prometheus__ to scrape the Metrics from our MQTT Gateway...

1.  Download and unzip __Prometheus__...

    [__"Prometheus Download"__](https://prometheus.io/download/)

1.  In the unzipped folder, edit the Prometheus Configuration File...

    [__prometheus.yml__](https://github.com/lupyuen/prometheus-the-things-network#configure-prometheus)

    ![Prometheus Configuration for MQTT Gateway](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-config6.png)

1.  Under the __`scrape_configs`__ section, add the following...

    ```yaml
    ## Scrape configuration containing the endpoints to scrape
    scrape_configs:
    ...

      ## Scrape The Things Network Metrics from MQTT2Prometheus
      - job_name: "ttn"

        ## Metrics will be scraped from MQTT2Prometheus
        ## at http://localhost:9641/metrics
        static_configs:
          - targets: ["localhost:9641"]
    ```

1.  Note that Prometheus will scrape the Metrics from MQTT Gateway __every 15 seconds__...

    ```yaml
    ## Global Configuration
    global:

      ## Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds
      scrape_interval: 15s
    ```

1.  Start the __Prometheus Server__...

    ```bash
    ## Change this to the unzipped path of Prometheus
    cd prometheus

    ## For Linux and macOS:
    ./prometheus

    ## For Windows:
    prometheus.exe
    ```

1.  We should see...

    ```text
    main.go:400
    "No time or size retention was set so using the default time retention" duration=15d

    main.go:438
    "Starting Prometheus" version="(version=2.30.3, branch=HEAD, revision=f29caccc42557f6a8ec30ea9b3c8c089391bd5df)"

    web.go:541
    "Start listening for connections" address=0.0.0.0:9090

    main.go:852
    "TSDB started"    

    main.go:794
    "Server is ready to receive web requests."
    ```

1.  Prometheus is now listening for __HTTP Requests at port 9090__!

## Checkpoint Charlie

Let's check the __Metrics scraped by Prometheus__ from MQTT Gateway...

1.  Start our __LoRaWAN Firmware__ and transmit Sensor Data every minute

    [(Like this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/tsen#run-the-lorawan-firmware)

1.  Browse to our __Prometheus Server__...

    ```uri
    http://localhost:9090
    ```

1.  Enter the __name of our Metric__ (like for Temperature)...

    ```text
    t
    ```

    Like this...

    ![Checking the Metrics scraped by Prometheus from MQTT Gateway](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-metric2.png)

1.  Click __"Execute"__ and __"Graph"__

    Our Metric appears in the graph.

    (See pic above)

We're ready for our final step... Connecting Prometheus to Grafana!

![Grafana Dashboard for Prometheus](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-flow4.jpg)

# Grafana Dashboard

Finally we __install and configure Grafana__ to pull the Metrics from Prometheus (over HTTP) for rendering in a Grafana Dashboard...

1.  Follow the steps below to __download and install Grafana__...

    [__"Install Grafana"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/prometheus#appendix-install-grafana)

1.  Browse to our __Grafana Server__...

    __`http://localhost:3000`__

    __Username:__ admin

    __Password:__ admin

1.  In the left menu bar, click...

    __Configuration__ → __Data Sources__

    Click __"Add Data Source"__

    ![Add Data Source](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/grafana-datasource4.png)

1.  Look for __"Prometheus"__ and click __"Select"__

    ![Prometheus Data Source for Grafana](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-datasource.png)

1.  Set the __HTTP URL__ to...

    ```uri
    http://localhost:9090
    ```

    ![Grafana Data Source for Prometheus](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-grafana5.png)

1.  Click __"Save & Test"__

## Checkpoint Delta

For our final checkpoint let's render our Sensor Data in a __Grafana Dashboard__!

1.  Start our __LoRaWAN Firmware__ and transmit Sensor Data every minute

    [(Like this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/tsen#run-the-lorawan-firmware)

1.  In Grafana, click __"Add Panel"__ (top right)

    Click __"Add An Empty Panel"__

    ![Add Panel](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/grafana-dashboard3.png)

1.  Set the __Data Source__ to __"Prometheus"__

    Under __Metric Browser__: Enter the name of our Metric (like for Temperature)...

    ```text
    t
    ```

    Like this...

    ![Grafana Panel for Prometheus](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-grafana6.png)

1.  Click the __"Save"__ button (top right)

1.  Our __Sensor Data from The Things Network__ appears in the Grafana Dashboard!

    ![Monitoring Devices on The Things Network with Prometheus and Grafana](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-grafana4.png)

    (Remember: Our Temperature Values are scaled up 100 times)

# Transform and Filter Sensor Data

_Can we tweak the display of Sensor Data in Grafana?_

Grafana lets us __transform and filter__ the Sensor Data for our Dashboard.

First we show the __Raw Sensor Data__ as a table...

1.  Click __"Panel Title"__ and __"Edit"__

1.  Click __"Table View"__ (at top)

    ![Table View for Grafana Panel](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-table.png)

1.  Not quite what we expected... Everything gets lumped into a __single column__!

    Let's __split our Time Series Data__ into separate columns.

1.  Click __"Transform"__ Tab (at bottom)

    Click __"Add Transformation"__

    Select __"Labels To Fields"__

1.  We should see this...

    ![Labels to Fields for Grafana Panel](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-transform.png)

    Much better! Our __Device ID__ ("sensor"), __Sensor Type__ ("t") and __Value__ are now in separate columns.

1.  If we're rendering __Multiple Devices or Sensor Types__, we should set the __Value Field Name__

    [(See this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/prometheus#notes)

Next we __filter the Sensor Data__ that will be rendered in our Dashboard...

1.  Click __"Transform"__ Tab (at bottom)

    Click __"Add Transformation"__

    Select __"Filter Data By Values"__

1.  Click __"Add Condition"__ and set the Condition...

    ![Grafana Panel with Filter](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-filter.png)

1.  The above filter matches the __Device ID__ with the Regular Expression...

    ```text
    eui-70b3.*
    ```

    Which means that only Device IDs starting with __"eui-70b3"__ will be rendered.

1.  When we're done, click the __"Apply"__ button (top right)

## Auto Dashboard Refresh

_Our Grafana Dashboard doesn't refresh automatically for real-time Sensor Data?_

No worries! This neat trick will __auto-refresh our Grafana Dashboard__ to render real-time Sensor Data...

1.  In our Grafana Dashboard, click the __"Settings"__ button (top right)

    ![Dashboard Settings](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-refresh3.png)

1.  Under __"Time Options"__, uncheck __"Hide Time Picker"__

    ![Hide Time Picker](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-refresh2.png)

1.  Click __"Save Dashboard"__

1.  Click the __"Refresh Interval"__ (top right)

    Select __"5 Seconds"__

    ![Refresh Interval](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-refresh4.png)

    Now our Grafana Dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 seconds!

# MQTT with TLS Encryption

There's a __Security Risk__ in our configuration of MQTT Gateway...

Our __MQTT Password is transmitted as clear text__ from our computer to The Things Network!

To secure our MQTT Password with __TLS Encryption__, follow the instructions here...

-   [__"MQTT with TLS Encryption"__](https://github.com/lupyuen/prometheus-the-things-network#mqtt-with-tls)

![MQTT with TLS Encryption](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-tls.jpg)

## Checkpoint Echo

_What if we have problems enabling TLS Encryption for MQTT?_

Run [__Wireshark__](https://www.wireshark.org/) on our computer and trace the __TLS Certificates__ that are presented by The Things Network and by our computer.

The certificates should appear like this...

![Tracing MQTT with TLS Encryption](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-wireshark2.png)

# Sensor Data Alerts

_Can we create Alerts for monitoring our Sensor Data?_

_Like when the Temperature gets too hot?_

Yes that's possible with __Prometheus Alert Manager__!

> "The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server."

> "It takes care of __deduplicating, grouping, and routing__ them to the correct receiver integration such as __email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie__."

> "It also takes care of __silencing and inhibition__ of alerts."

More details here...

-   [__Prometheus Alert Manager__](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/)

# What's Next

I had fun integrating The Things Network with Prometheus and Grafana... It's something I always wanted to do. I hope you enjoyed it too!

In the next article I'll head back to [__PineDio Stack BL604__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pinedio2) and run more IoT Experiments with LoRaWAN and The Things Network.

(Thankfully we now have a proper platform for Sensor Data visualisation and analysis: Prometheus + Grafana!)

1.  If we're rendering __Multiple Sensor Types__ in a Grafana Panel (like Temperature and Light Level)...

    Set __Labels To Fields__ → __Value Field Name__ to __"sensor_type"__...

    ![Rendering multiple Sensor Types](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/prometheus-transform2.png)

    This fixes the graph to plot one line per Sensor Type.

1.  If we're rendering __Multiple Devices__ in a Grafana Panel...

    Set __Labels To Fields__ → __Value Field Name__ to __"sensor"__...

    This fixes the graph to plot one line per Device.

1.  Why not use an SQL Database (like MySQL) instead of Prometheus?

    Well an SQL Database might not scale up for high volumes of Sensor Data because...

    -   SQL Inserts can be costly, due to the frequent indexing. If we run SQL Select queries too often, we might have contention in the SQL Index.

    -   SQL doesn't work well with time-based queries like "What's the average daily temperature every day for the past year". It gets tedious to code such queries (nested SQL) and they don't perform well.

    That's why we use a Time Series Database like Prometheus. And when we use a Time Series Database, we need a tool like Grafana that can visualise the Time Series Data.
