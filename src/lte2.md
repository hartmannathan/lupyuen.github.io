What makes [__Pine64 PinePhone__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone) a phone? It's the [__4G LTE Modem__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)) inside that makes Phone Calls and sends Text Messages!

Now we're building a [__Feature Phone__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/usb2#pinephone--nuttx--feature-phone) with [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/what) (Real-Time Operating System). To make things simpler, we're writing down __everything we know__ about the 4G LTE Modem, and how it works inside PinePhone...
