# Preparing a Pull Request for Apache NuttX RTOS

üìù _30 Nov 2022_

![TODO](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pr-title.jpg)

This article explains how I prepared my Pull Requests for submission to [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html). So if we're contributing code to NuttX, just follow these steps and things will (probably) go hunky dory!

Before we begin, please check out the official __Development Workflow__ for NuttX...

-   [__"NuttX Development Workflow"__](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/contributing/workflow.html)

OK let's dive in!

![Create Fork](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pr-fork.png)

# NuttX Repositories

We begin by __creating our forks__ for the __`nuttx`__ and __`apps`__ repositories...

1.  Browse to __NuttX Repository__...

    [__github.com/apache/nuttx__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx)

    Click "__Fork__" to create our fork. (Pic above)

    Click "__Actions__" and enable workflows...

    ![Enable Workflows](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pr-actions.png)

    (This will check that our code compiles OK at every commit)

1.  Do the same for the __NuttX Apps Repository__...

    [__github.com/apache/nuttx-apps__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx-apps)

    Click "__Fork__" to create our fork.

    Click "__Actions__" and enable workflows.

1.  As a principle, let's keep our __`master`__ branch __always in sync__ with the NuttX Mainline __`master`__ branch.

    (This seems cleaner for syncing upstream updates into our repo)

    Let's __create a branch__ to make our changes...

1.  In our NuttX Repository, click __`master`__.

    Enter the name of our new branch.
    
    Click "__Create Branch__"

    ![Create Branch](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pr-branch.png)

    [(I named my branch __`gic`__ for Generic Interrupt Controller)](https://github.com/lupyuen2/wip-pinephone-nuttx/tree/gic)

1.  Do the same for our __NuttX Apps Repository__

    (Because we should sync __`nuttx`__ and __`apps`__ too)

1.  Download the new branches of our __`nuttx`__ and __`apps`__ repositories...

    ```bash
    ## Download the "gic" branch of "lupyuen2/wip-pinephone-nuttx"
    ## TODO: Change the branch name and repo URLs
    mkdir nuttx
    cd nuttx
    git clone \
      --branch gic \
      https://github.com/lupyuen2/wip-pinephone-nuttx \
      nuttx
    git clone \
      --branch gic \
      https://github.com/lupyuen2/wip-pinephone-nuttx-apps \
      apps
    ```

    We're now ready to code!

# Build and Test


TODO

- test locally
- capture the log
- don't wait too long because upstream may change

- create a PR in a branch
- testable (QEMU)
- small modular self-contained feature

- sometimes GitHub Actions will fail. Just re-run the failed jobs [(Like this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pr-rerun.png)

```text
Error response from daemon:
login attempt to https://ghcr.io/v2/
failed with status: 503 Service Unavailable"
```

## Regression Testing

_Will our modified code break other parts of NuttX?_

That's why it's good to run a [__Regression Test__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing) (if feasible) to be sure that other parts of NuttX aren't affected by our modified code.

TODO

- regression testing
- (optional) logs, super helpful for debugging

For our Pull Request...

[arch/arm64: Add support for Generic Interrupt Controller Version 2](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/pull/7630)

run.sh QEMU: https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/5e2fba642a33bf64d3378df3795042d7
- QEMU good for regression testing
- Since we might not have the actual hw
- How to support PinePhone UART in QEMU?
- Zig Extension?

(Yeah it will be hard to run a Regression Test if it requires hardware that we don't have)

- Best if can convert to NuttX style 
- Check one last time
