This article explains how I prepared my Pull Requests for submission to Apache NuttX RTOS. So if we're contributing code to NuttX, just follow these steps and things will (probably) go hunky dory!

[Development Workflow](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/contributing/workflow.html)

# NuttX Repositories

TODO

- master branch always in sync with mainline
- Enable github actions
- Why lupyuen2

- create a PR in a branch
- testable (QEMU)
- small modular self-contained feature

# Build and Test

TODO

- test locally
- capture the log
- don't wait too long because upstream may change
- regression testing
- (optional) logs, super helpful for debugging

Docs: https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/contributing/documentation.html

run.sh QEMU: https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/5e2fba642a33bf64d3378df3795042d7
- QEMU good for regression testing
- Since we might not have the actual hw
- How to support PinePhone UART in QEMU?
- Zig Extension?

# Check Coding Style

TODO

[NuttX C Coding Standard](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/contributing/coding_style.html)

nxstyle:

```bash
gcc -o $HOME/nxstyle $HOME/PinePhone/wip-nuttx/nuttx/tools/nxstyle.c

$HOME/nxstyle $HOME/PinePhone/wip-nuttx/nuttx/arch/arm64/Kconfig

- VSCode Extension?
- Linux checkpatch? https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=idanp.checkpatch
- Best if can convert to NuttX style 
- Check one last time
