[_Apache NuttX RTOS booting on Pine64 PinePhone_](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-nuttx#nuttx-boot-log)

__UPDATE:__ PinePhone is now officially supported by Apache NuttX RTOS [(See this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot#appendix-pinephone-is-now-supported-by-apache-nuttx-rtos)

Suppose we're creating our own __Operating System__ (non-Linux) for [__Pine64 PinePhone__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone)...

-   What's the File Format?

-   Where in RAM should it run?

-   Can we make a microSD that will boot our OS?

-   What happens when PinePhone powers on?

This article explains how we ported [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/arm) to PinePhone. And we'll answer the questions along the way!

Let's walk through the steps to create our own __PinePhone Operating System__...

[_Allwinner A64 SoC User Manual_](https://dl.linux-sunxi.org/A64/A64_Datasheet_V1.1.pdf)

# Allwinner A64 SoC

_What's inside PinePhone?_

At the heart of PinePhone is the [__Allwinner A64 SoC__](https://linux-sunxi.org/A64) (System-on-a-Chip) with 4 Cores of 64-bit __Arm Cortex-A53__...

-   [__PinePhone Wiki__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone)

-   [__Allwinner A64 Info__](https://linux-sunxi.org/A64)

-   [__Allwinner A64 User Manual__](https://dl.linux-sunxi.org/A64/A64_Datasheet_V1.1.pdf)

The A64 SoC in PinePhone comes with __2GB RAM__ (or 3GB RAM via a mainboard upgrade)...

-   [__Allwinner A64 Memory Map__](https://linux-sunxi.org/A64/Memory_map)

A64's __Memory Map__ says that the RAM starts at address __`0x4000` `0000`__.

_So our OS will run at `0x4000` `0000`?_

Not quite! Our OS will actually be loaded at __`0x4008` `0000`__

We'll see why in a while, but first we talk about a Very Important Cable...

![PinePhone connected to USB Serial Debug Cable](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/arm-uart2.jpg)

[_PinePhone connected to USB Serial Debug Cable_](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Serial_console)

# USB Serial Debug Cable

_Can we watch what happens when PinePhone boots?_

There's a magical cable for that: __USB Serial Debug Cable__ (pic above)...

-   [__PinePhone Serial Debug Cable__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Serial_console)

It connects to PinePhone's __Headphone Port__ (pic below) and exposes PinePhone's hidden __UART Port.__ Genius!

[(Remember to flip the Headphone Switch to OFF)](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Privacy_switch_configuration)

I highly recommend the USB Serial Debug Cable for __PinePhone Hacking__.

_What secrets will the Debug Cable reveal?_

We'll find out shortly! First we need to prep our microSD Card for hacking...

[_PinePhone UART Port in disguise_](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Serial_console)

# PinePhone Jumpdrive

Let's watch and learn how a __Linux Kernel__ boots on PinePhone.

We pick a small, simple Linux Kernel: __PinePhone Jumpdrive__...

-   [__dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive__](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive)

And prepare a __microSD Card__ for Jumpdrive...

1.  Download [__`pine64-pinephone.img.xz`__](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/releases/download/0.8/pine64-pinephone.img.xz)

1.  Write the downloaded file to a microSD Card with [__Balena Etcher__](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

1.  Insert the microSD Card into PinePhone

Don't power up PinePhone yet! We need to talk about PinePhone's Bootloader...

![PinePhone Jumpdrive on microSD](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/arm-jumpdrive.png)

[_PinePhone Jumpdrive on microSD_](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive)

# U-Boot Bootloader

_What happens when we power up PinePhone?_

The [__U-Boot Bootloader__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_U-Boot) runs, searching for a Linux Kernel to boot (on microSD or eMMC)...

-   [__Allwinner A64 Boot ROM__](https://linux-sunxi.org/BROM#A64)

-   [__Allwinner A64 U-Boot__](https://linux-sunxi.org/U-Boot)

-   [__Allwinner A64 U-Boot SPL__](https://linux-sunxi.org/BROM#U-Boot_SPL_limitations)

    (Secondary Program Loader)

-   [__SD Card Layout__](https://linux-sunxi.org/Bootable_SD_card#SD_Card_Layout)

_Whoa! These docs look so superdry..._

There's an easier way to grok U-Boot. Let's watch PinePhone boot Jumpdrive!

![U-Boot Bootloader on PinePhone](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/uboot-uboot.png)

[_U-Boot Bootloader on PinePhone_](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/arm#appendix-pinephone-uart-log)

# Boot Log

Now we're ready to watch what happens when PinePhone boots...

1.  Insert the __Jumpdrive microSD__ into PinePhone

1.  Flip PinePhone's [__Headphone Switch__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Privacy_switch_configuration) to OFF

1.  Connect our computer to PinePhone via the [__USB Serial Debug Cable__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Serial_console)

1.  Launch a __Serial Terminal__ (115.2 kbps) on our computer and connect to PinePhone...

    For Linux:

    ```bash
    ## Change ttyUSB0 to the USB Serial Device
    sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
    ```

    For macOS: Use __`screen`__ or [__CoolTerm__](https://freeware.the-meiers.org/)

    For Windows: Use [__PuTTY__](https://www.putty.org/)

1.  Power up PinePhone

This is the __Boot Log__ that we'll see...

```text

```

__BL31__ refers to [__Arm Trusted Firmware__](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/arm-trusted-firmware/+/v1.2-rc0/docs/firmware-design.md), the very first thing that runs on PinePhone.

BL31 finds the __Device Tree__ (DTB) for the U-Boot Bootloader, and starts U-Boot...

```text

```

Yep U-Boot __can be stopped!__ Later we'll hit some keys to stop U-Boot and run some commands.

But for now we let U-Boot do its booting thing...

```text

mmc0 is current device
Scanning mmc 0:1...

653 bytes read in 3 ms (211.9 KiB/s)
```

U-Boot scans our microSD and discovers a __U-Boot Script `boot.scr`__

(We'll talk more about the script)

The U-Boot Script __loads the Linux Kernel__ into RAM and starts it...

```text

/ #
```

The __Linux Kernel__ is running! It works like we expect...

```text
/ # uname -a

/ # ls

etc                proc               sys
```

And that's how PinePhone boots a Linux Kernel, thanks to the U-Boot Bootloader!

# Boot Script

_What's `boot.scr`?_

```text
Found U-Boot script /boot.scr
```

According to the log above, the U-Boot Bootloader runs the __U-Boot Script `boot.scr`__ to...

-   Light up the PinePhone LED (I think?)

-   Load the __Linux Kernel `Image.gz`__ into RAM

    (At `0x4408` `0000`)

-   Unzip the __Linux Kernel `Image.gz`__ in RAM

    (At `0x4008` `0000`)

-   Load the __Linux Device Tree__...

    `sun50i-a64-pinephone-1.2.dtb`

    (At `0x4FA0` `0000`)

-   Load the __RAM File System `initramfs.gz`__

    (At `0x4FE0` `0000`)

-   Boot the __Unzipped Linux Kernel__ in RAM

    (At `0x4008` `0000`)

Here's the Source File: [Jumpdrive/src/pine64-pinephone.txt](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/blob/master/src/pine64-pinephone.txt)

```bash
setenv kernel_addr_z 0x44080000

setenv bootargs loglevel=0 silent console=tty0 vt.global_cursor_default=0

gpio set 114

if load ${devtype} ${devnum}:${distro_bootpart} ${kernel_addr_z} /Image.gz; then
  unzip ${kernel_addr_z} ${kernel_addr_r}
  if load ${devtype} ${devnum}:${distro_bootpart} ${fdt_addr_r} /sun50i-a64-pinephone-1.2.dtb; then
    if load ${devtype} ${devnum}:${distro_bootpart} ${ramdisk_addr_r} /initramfs.gz; then
      booti ${kernel_addr_r} ${ramdisk_addr_r}:${filesize} ${fdt_addr_r};
    else
      booti ${kernel_addr_r} - ${fdt_addr_r};
    fi;
  fi;
fi
```

(We'll explain _fdt_addr_r_, _kernel_addr_r_ and _ramdisk_addr_r_)

The above U-Boot Script __`pine64-pinephone.txt`__ is compiled to __`boot.scr`__ by this Makefile: [Jumpdrive/Makefile](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/blob/master/Makefile#L207-L209)

```text
%.scr: src/%.txt
	@echo "MKIMG $@"
	@mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -n "U-Boot boot script" -d $< $@
```

[(__`mkimage`__ is documented here)](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/mkimage.1.html)

# Boot Address

_What are fdt_addr_r, kernel_addr_r and ramdisk_addr_r?_

They are __Environment Variables__ defined in U-Boot. To see the variables in U-Boot...

1.  Power off PinePhone

1.  On our computer's Serial Terminal, keep hitting Enter, don't stop...

1.  Power up PinePhone

U-Boot should stop and reveal the __U-Boot Prompt__...

```text
U-Boot 2020.07 (Nov 08 2020 - 00:15:12 +0100)
Hit any key to stop autoboot:
=>
```

Enter __`printenv`__ to print the __Environment Variables__...

```text
=> printenv
kernel_addr_r=0x40080000
fdt_addr_r=0x4FA00000
ramdisk_addr_r=0x4FE00000
```

[(See the Complete Log)](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-nuttx#pinephone-u-boot-log)

When we match these addresses with our [__U-Boot Script__](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/blob/master/src/pine64-pinephone.txt), we discover...

-   __`kernel_addr_r`__: Linux Kernel `Image` will be unzipped into RAM at __`0x4008` `0000`__. And it will execute at that address.

-   __`fdt_addr_r`__: Linux Device Tree `sun50i*.dtb` will be loaded into RAM at __`0x4FA0` `0000`__

-   __`ramdisk_addr_r`__: Linux RAM File System `initramfs` will be loaded into RAM at __`0x4FE0` `0000`__

_Aha that's why our kernel must start at `0x4008` `0000`!_

Yep! Thus we can...

-   Compile our own operating system to start at __`0x4008` `0000`__

-   Replace __`Image.gz`__ in the microSD by our compiled OS (gzipped)

And PinePhone will __boot our own OS!__ (Theoretically)

But there's a catch: U-Boot expects to find a Linux Kernel Header in our OS...

# Linux Kernel Header

_What! A Linux Kernel Header in our non-Linux OS?_

Yep it's totally strange, but U-Boot Bootloader expects our OS to begin with an __Arm64 Linux Kernel Header__ as defined here...

-   [__"Booting AArch64 Linux"__](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/arm64/booting.html)

The doc says that a Linux Kernel Image (for Arm64) should begin with this __64-byte header__...

```text
u32 code0;              /* Executable code */
u32 code1;              /* Executable code */
u64 text_offset;        /* Image load offset, little endian */
u64 image_size;         /* Effective Image size, little endian */
u64 flags;              /* kernel flags, little endian */
u64 res2  = 0;          /* reserved */
u64 res3  = 0;          /* reserved */
u64 res4  = 0;          /* reserved */
u32 magic = 0x644d5241; /* Magic number, little endian, "ARM\x64" */
u32 res5;               /* reserved (used for PE COFF offset) */
```

[(Source)](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/arm64/booting.html)

Let's make a Linux Kernel Header to appease U-Boot...

# NuttX Header

_How do we make a Linux Kernel Header in our non-Linux OS?_

Apache NuttX RTOS can help!

This is how we created the __Arm64 Linux Kernel Header__ in NuttX: [arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S#L79-L117)

```text
  /* Kernel startup entry point.
   * ---------------------------
   *
   * This must be the very first address in the loaded image.
   * It should be loaded at any 4K-aligned address.
   * __start will be set to 0x4008 0000 in the Linker Script
   */
  .globl __start;
__start:

  /* DO NOT MODIFY. Image header expected by Linux boot-loaders.
   *
   * This add instruction has no meaningful effect except that
   * its opcode forms the magic "MZ" signature of a PE/COFF file
   * that is required for UEFI applications.
   */
  add     x13, x18, #0x16  /* the magic "MZ" signature */
  b       real_start       /* branch to kernel start */
```

[("MZ" refers to Mark Zbikowski)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_MZ_executable)

The header begins at __Kernel Start Address `0x4008` `0000`__.

At the top of the header we jump to __`real_start`__ to skip the header.

(NuttX code begins at __`real_start`__ after the header)

Then comes the rest of the header...

```text
  /* PinePhone Image load offset from start of RAM */
  .quad   0x0000  

  /* Effective size of kernel image, little-endian */
  .quad   _e_initstack - __start

  /* Informative flags, little-endian */
  .quad   __HEAD_FLAGS

  .quad   0          /* reserved */
  .quad   0          /* reserved */
  .quad   0          /* reserved */
  .ascii  "ARM\x64"  /* Magic number, "ARM\x64" */
  .long   0          /* reserved */

/* NuttX OS Code begins here, after the header */
real_start: ... 
```

[(__`_e_initstack`__ is End of Stack Space)](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/boards/arm64/a64/pinephone/scripts/dramboot.ld#L97-L106)

[(__`__HEAD_FLAGS`__ is defined here)](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S#L41-L49)

[(__UPDATE:__ We don't need to change the Image Load Offset)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot#porting-notes)

_What's the value of `__start`?_

Remember __`kernel_addr_r`__, the [__Kernel Start Address__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot#boot-address) from U-Boot?

In NuttX, we define the Kernel Start Address __`__start`__ as __`0x4008` `0000`__ in our Linker Script: [boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-a53/scripts/dramboot](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/boards/arm64/a64/pinephone/scripts/dramboot.ld#L30-L34)

```text
SECTIONS
{
  /* PinePhone uboot load address (kernel_addr_r) */
  . = 0x40080000;
  _start = .;
```

We also updated the Kernel Start Address in the NuttX __Memory Map__...

-   [__"Memory Map"__](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-nuttx#memory-map)

We're almost ready to boot NuttX on PinePhone!

_Will we see anything when NuttX boots on PinePhone?_

Not yet. We need to implement the UART Driver...

![Allwinner A64 UART Controller Registers](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/uboot-uart1.png)

[_Allwinner A64 UART Controller Registers_](https://dl.linux-sunxi.org/A64/A64_Datasheet_V1.1.pdf)

# UART Output

Our operating system will show some output on PinePhone's __Serial Debug Console__ as it boots.

To do that, we'll talk to the __UART Controller__ on the Allwinner A64 SoC...

-   [__Allwinner A64 User Manual__](https://dl.linux-sunxi.org/A64/A64_Datasheet_V1.1.pdf)

Flip the [__A64 User Manual__](https://dl.linux-sunxi.org/A64/A64_Datasheet_V1.1.pdf) to page 562 ("UART") and we'll see the __UART Registers__. (Pic above)

PinePhone's Serial Console is connected to __UART0__ at Base Address __`0x01C2` `8000`__

The First Register of UART0 is what we need: __UART_THR__ at __`0x01C2` `8000`__...

![A64 UART Register UART_THR](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/uboot-uart2.png)

_What's UART_THR?_

__UART_THR__ is the __Transmit Holding Register__.

We'll write our output data to __`0x01C2` `8000`__, byte by byte, and the data will appear in the Serial Console. Let's do that!

_Did we forget something?_

Rightfully we should wait for __THR Empty__ (Transmit Buffer Empty) before sending our data.

And we should initialise the __UART Baud Rate__. We'll come back to this.

# NuttX UART Macros

NuttX writes to the UART Port with some clever __Arm Assembly Macros__.

This Assembly Code in NuttX...

```text
cpu_boot:
  PRINT(cpu_boot, "- Ready to Boot CPU\r\n")
```

[(Source)](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S#L176-L179)

Calls our [__`PRINT` Macro__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S#L58-L69) to print a string at startup.

Which is super convenient because our [__Startup Code__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S) has plenty of Assembly Code!

_What's inside the macro?_

Our [__`PRINT` Macro__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S#L58-L69) calls...

-   [__`boot_stage_puts`__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S#L292-L308) Function, which calls...

-   [__`up_lowputc`__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/a64/a64_lowputc.S#L81-L91) Function

Which loads our __UART Base Address__...

```text
/* PinePhone Allwinner A64 UART0 Base Address: */
#define UART0_BASE_ADDRESS 0x1C28000

/* Print a character on the UART - this function is called by C
 * x0: character to print
 */
GTEXT(up_lowputc)
SECTION_FUNC(text, up_lowputc)
  ldr   x15, =UART0_BASE_ADDRESS  /* Load UART Base Address */
  early_uart_ready    x15, w2     /* Wait for UART ready    */
  early_uart_transmit x15, w0     /* Transmit to UART       */
  ret
```

[(Source)](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/a64/a64_lowputc.S#L81-L91) 

And calls [__`early_uart_transmit`__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/a64/a64_lowputc.S#L87-L94) Macro to transmit a character...

```text
/* UART transmit character
 * xb: register which contains the UART base address
 * wt: register which contains the character to transmit
 */
.macro early_uart_transmit xb, wt
  /* Write to UART_THR (Transmit Holding Register) */
  strb  \wt, [\xb]
.endm
```

[(Source)](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/a64/a64_lowputc.S#L81-L91)

That's how we print a string to the console at startup!

_What's `early_uart_ready`?_

__`early_uart_ready`__ Macro waits for the UART Port to be __ready to transmit__, as explained here...

-   [__"Wait for UART Ready"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot#wait-for-uart-ready)

_How do we initialise the UART Port?_

Right now we don't __initialise the UART Port__ because U-Boot has kindly done it for us. Eventually this needs to be fixed: [qemu_lowputc.S](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/a64/a64_lowputc.S#L51-L72)

```text
/* UART initialization
 * xb: register which contains the UART base address
 * c: scratch register number
 */
GTEXT(up_earlyserialinit)
SECTION_FUNC(text, up_earlyserialinit)
  ## TODO: Set PinePhone Allwinner A64 Baud Rate Divisor:
  ## Write to UART_LCR (DLAB), UART_DLL and UART_DLH
  ...
```

[(__`up_earlyserialinit`__ is called by our Startup Code)](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S#L168-L176)

_Can we boot our own OS on PinePhone... By replacing a single file on Jumpdrive microSD?_

Earlier we said that we'll overwrite __`Image.gz` on Jumpdrive microSD__ to boot our own OS...

    [__"Build NuttX for PinePhone"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot#appendix-build-nuttx-for-pinephone)

    Or __download `nuttx.bin`__ from here (includes BASIC Interpreter)...

    [__NuttX Binary Image for PinePhone: `nuttx.bin`__](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-nuttx/releases/download/v1.0.12/nuttx.bin)

1.  Compress the __NuttX Binary Image__...

    ```bash
    ## Compress the NuttX Binary Image
    cp nuttx.bin Image
    rm -f Image.gz
    gzip Image
    ```

    Or __download `Image.gz`__ from here (includes BASIC Interpreter)...

    [__Compressed NuttX Binary Image: `Image.gz`__](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-nuttx/releases/download/v1.0.12/Image.gz)

1.  Overwrite __`Image.gz`__ on __Jumpdrive microSD__...

    ```bash
    ## Copy compressed NuttX Binary Image to Jumpdrive microSD
    ## TODO: Change the microSD Path
    cp Image.gz "/Volumes/NO NAME"
    ```

1.  Connect PinePhone to our computer with a __USB Serial Debug Cable__...

    [__"Boot Log"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot#boot-log)

1.  Insert __Jumpdrive microSD__ into PinePhone and power up

On our computer's [__Serial Terminal__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot#boot-log), we see PinePhone's __U-Boot Bootloader__ loading NuttX RTOS into RAM...

[_Arm64 Source Files in NuttX_](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/arch/arm64/src/common)

# NuttX Source Code

Apache NuttX RTOS has plenty of __Arm64 Code__ that will be helpful to creators of PinePhone Operating Systems.

The __Arm64 Architecture Functions__ (pic above) are defined here...

-   [arch/arm64/src/common](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/arch/arm64/src/common)

These functions implement all kinds of Arm64 Features: [__FPU__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_fpu.c), [__Interrupts__](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-nuttx#interrupt-controller), [__MMU__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_mmu.c), [__Tasks__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_task_sched.c), [__Timers__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_arch_timer.c), ...

The __Arm64 Startup Code__ (including Linux Kernel Header) is at...

-   [arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S)

Previously NuttX supports only one __Arm64 Target Board__: QEMU Emulator.

Below are the Source Files and Build Configuration for __QEMU Emulator__...

-   [boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-armv8a](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-armv8a)

We clone this to create a Target Board for PinePhone...

-   [boards/arm64/a64/pinephone](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/boards/arm64/a64/pinephone)

And we start the __Board-Specific Drivers__ for PinePhone in [pinephone_bringup.c](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/boards/arm64/a64/pinephone/src/pinephone_bringup.c)

Our Board calls the __Architecture-Specific Drivers__ at...

-   [arch/arm64/src/a64](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/arch/arm64/src/a64)

The __UART Driver__ is located at [a64_serial.c](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/a64/a64_serial.c) and [a64_lowputc.S](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/arch/arm64/src/a64/a64_lowputc.S)

[(More about UART Driver)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot#uart-driver)

The __QEMU Target for NuttX__ is described in this article...

-   [__"Apache NuttX RTOS on Arm Cortex-A53: How it might run on PinePhone"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/arm)

# What's Next

It's indeed possible to __boot our own OS__ on PinePhone... By __replacing a single file__ on Jumpdrive microSD!

We've done that with __Apache NuttX RTOS__, which has plenty of code that will be helpful for PinePhone OS Developers.

_Will NuttX work with all PinePhone features?_

__NuttX on PinePhone__ might take a while to become a __Daily Driver__...

## Upcoming Fixes

These are the __Upcoming Fixes__ for NuttX on PinePhone...

1.  Fix the garbled __Startup Messages__

    [(More about this)](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/pull/7692)

1.  __RAM Size__ will be increased to 2 GB: [chip.h](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/include/a64/chip.h#L45-L48)

    ```c
    // Allwinner A64 Memory Map
    // TODO: Increase RAM to 2 GB
    #define CONFIG_RAMBANK1_ADDR      0x40000000
    #define CONFIG_RAMBANK1_SIZE      MB(128)
    ```

1.  Only __Single Core CPU__ has been tested on PinePhone: [pinephone/defconfig](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/boards/arm64/a64/pinephone/configs/nsh/defconfig)

    We shall test __Quad Core CPU__ on PinePhone: [qemu-armv8a/nsh_smp/defconfig](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/boards/arm64/qemu/qemu-armv8a/configs/nsh_smp/defconfig#L0-L1)

    ```text
    ## TODO: Enable Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) for PinePhone
    CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK=8192
    CONFIG_DEFAULT_TASK_STACKSIZE=16384
    CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE=16384
    CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_MIN=16384
    CONFIG_SMP=y
    CONFIG_SYSTEM_TASKSET=y
    CONFIG_TESTING_OSTEST_STACKSIZE=16384
    CONFIG_TESTING_SMP=y
    ```

1.  Enable __Memory Protection__ so that NuttX Apps can't access NuttX Kernel Memory and Hardware Registers.

## Porting Notes

__Porting Notes__ for NuttX on PinePhone...

1.  [__Image Load Offset__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot#nuttx-header) in the Linux Kernel Header isn't used: [arm64_head.S](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_head.S#L79-L117)

    ```text
    .quad 0x480000 /* Image load offset from start of RAM */
    ```

    NuttX boots OK without changing the Image Load Offset.

    (Seems the Image Load Offset is not used by the U-Boot Bootloader. It's probably used by the Linux Kernel only)

1.  Previously the __Vector Base Address Register__ for EL1 was set incorrectly. [(See this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/interrupt#arm64-vector-table-is-wrong)

    The new code doesn't have this problem.
    
    (Is it due to the Image Load Offset?)

![Build NuttX](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/arm-build.png)

# Appendix: Build NuttX for PinePhone

__UPDATE:__ PinePhone is now officially supported by Apache NuttX RTOS [(See this)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot#appendix-pinephone-is-now-supported-by-apache-nuttx-rtos)

Follow these steps to build __Apache NuttX RTOS__ for PinePhone...

## Download NuttX

Download the Source Code for NuttX...

```bash
## Create NuttX Directory
mkdir nuttx
cd nuttx

## Download NuttX OS
git clone \
  https://github.com/apache/nuttx \
  nuttx

## Download NuttX Apps
git clone \
  https://github.com/apache/nuttx-apps \
  apps

## We'll build NuttX inside nuttx/nuttx
cd nuttx
```

## Install Prerequisites

Install the __Build Prerequisites__ below, but skip the RISC-V Toolchain...

-   [__"Install Prerequisites"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/nuttx#install-prerequisites)

## Download Toolchain

Download the Arm Toolchain for __AArch64 Bare-Metal Target `aarch64-none-elf`__...

-   [__Arm GNU Toolchain Downloads__](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)

    (Skip the section for Beta Releases)

For Linux x64 and WSL:

-   [gcc-arm-11.2-2022.02-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/11.2-2022.02/binrel/gcc-arm-11.2-2022.02-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz)

For macOS:

-   [arm-gnu-toolchain-11.3.rel1-darwin-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.pkg](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/11.3.rel1/binrel/arm-gnu-toolchain-11.3.rel1-darwin-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.pkg)

(I don't recommend building NuttX on Plain Old Windows CMD, please use WSL instead)

Add the downloaded Arm Toolchain to the __`PATH`__...

```bash
## For Linux x64 and WSL:
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/gcc-arm-11.2-2022.02-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf/bin"

## For macOS:
export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/ArmGNUToolchain/11.3.rel1/aarch64-none-elf/bin"
```

Check the Arm Toolchain...

```bash
$ aarch64-none-elf-gcc -v
gcc version 11.3.1 20220712 (Arm GNU Toolchain 11.3.Rel1)
```

## Build NuttX

Finally we __configure and build__ NuttX...

```bash
## Configure NuttX for Arm Cortex-A53 Single Core
## For PinePhone: Change "qemu-armv8a:nsh" to "pinephone:nsh"
./tools/configure.sh -l qemu-armv8a:nsh

## Build NuttX
make

## Dump the disassembly to nuttx.S
aarch64-none-elf-objdump \
  -t -S --demangle --line-numbers --wide \
  nuttx \
  >nuttx.S \
  2>&1
```

[(See the Build Log)](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/2c5db82c3103f52ed7ca99804f9220c1)

[(See our Build Script)](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/7e828ea476d12cffa5e535a215723908)

On an old MacBook Pro 2012, NuttX builds in 2 minutes.

If we wish to use the __BASIC Interpreter__, follow these steps to enable it...

-   [__"Enable BASIC"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/nuttx#enable-basic)

Then run __`make`__ to rebuild NuttX.

If the build fails with this error...

```text
token "@" is not valid in preprocessor
```

Look for this file in the Arm64 Toolchain...

```text
gcc-arm-none-eabi/arm-none-eabi/include/_newlib_version.h
```

And [__apply this patch__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/pull/7284/commits/518b0eb31cb66f25b590ae9a79ab16c319b96b94#diff-12291efd8a0ded1bc38bad733d99e4840ae5112b465c04287f91ba5169612c73).

# Appendix: Allwinner A64 UART

Earlier we talked about our implementation of __Allwinner A64 UART__...

-   [__`early_uart_ready`__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/a64/a64_lowputc.S#L72-L85) needs to wait for UART to be __ready to transmit__

-   [__`up_earlyserialinit`__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/a64/a64_lowputc.S#L51-L60) needs to __initialise the UART Port__

-   [__UART Driver__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/a64/a64_serial.c) needs to support __UART Input__

Let's talk about these changes...

## Wait for UART Ready

_How do we wait for the UART Port to be ready before we transmit data?_

See the pic above. According to the __Allwinner A64 UART__ doc (page 563, "UART")...

-   [__Allwinner A64 User Manual__](https://dl.linux-sunxi.org/A64/A64_Datasheet_V1.1.pdf)

We should write data to the UART Port...

ONLY WHEN the __THRE Bit__ is set.

(THRE means __Transmit Holding Register Empty__)

_Where's the THRE Bit?_

THRE Bit is __Bit 5__ (`0x20`) of UART_LSR.

__UART_LSR__ (Line Status Register) is at __Offset `0x14`__ from the UART Base Address.

In Arm64 Assembly, this is how we wait for the UART to be ready: [a64_lowputc.S](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/a64/a64_lowputc.S#L60-L72)

```text
/* PinePhone Allwinner A64: 
 * Wait for UART to be ready to transmit
 * xb: register which contains the UART base address
 * wt: scratch register number
 */

.macro early_uart_ready xb, wt
1:
  /* Load the Line Status Register at Offset 0x14 from UART Base Address */
  ldrh  \wt, [\xb, #0x14]

  /* Check the THRE Bit (Tx Holding Register Empty) */
  tst   \wt, #0x20

  /* If UART is not ready (THRE=0), jump back to label `1:` */
  b.eq  1b                     
.endm
```

## Initialise UART

_How will we initialise the UART Port?_

According to the __Allwinner A64 UART__ doc (page 562, "UART")...

-   [__Allwinner A64 User Manual__](https://dl.linux-sunxi.org/A64/A64_Datasheet_V1.1.pdf)

We might __initialise the UART Port__ in [__`up_earlyserialinit`__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/a64/a64_lowputc.S#L51-L60) like so...

1.  Set __DLAB Flag__ to allow update of UART Divisor...

    ```text
    ldr  x15, =UART1_BASE_ADDRESS
    mov  x0,  #0x80
    strb w0,  [x15, #0x0C]
    ```

1.  Write the __UART Divisor__ (Least Significant Byte) to UART_DLL...

    ```text
    mov  x0, #(divisor % 256)
    strb w0, [x15, #0x00]
    ```

1.  Write the __UART Divisor__ (Most Significant Byte) to UART_DLH...

    ```text
    mov  x0, #(divisor / 256)
    strb w0, [x15, #0x04]
    ```

1.  Clear __DLAB Flag__ to disallow update of UART Divisor...

    ```text
    mov  x0, #0x00
    strb w0, [x15, #0x0C]
    ```

[(Confused? __`x0`__ and __`w0`__ are actually the same register, 64-bit vs 32-bit)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102374/0100/Registers-in-AArch64---general-purpose-registers)

Where...

-   __DLAB (Divisor Latch Access Bit)__ is Bit 7 of UART_LCR

-   __UART_LCR (Line Control Register)__ is at Offset `0x0C` of the UART Base Address

-   __UART_DLL (Divisor Latch Low)__ is at Offset `0x00`

-   __UART_DLH (Divisor Latch High)__ is at Offset `0x04`

-   __UART Divisor__ is computed as...

    (Serial Clock Frequency / 16) / Baud Rate

__TODO:__ What is the Serial Clock Frequency (SCLK)?

## UART Driver

We have implemented the __UART Driver__ for PinePhone's Allwinner A64 UART Port...
