# Touchscreen Features

We're incredibly fortunate that __PinePhone's Touchscreen__ runs OK with NuttX, after we built these features (pic above)...

-   [__MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI)__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/dsi3) transmits pixel data to the [__LCD Panel__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lcd)

-   [__Allwinner Display Engine__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/de3) renders bitmap graphics and pushes the pixels over MIPI DSI

-   [__NuttX Framebuffer__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/fb) exposes the rendering API to NuttX Apps

-   [__I2C Touch Panel__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/touch2) detects Touch Input from the LCD Panel

-   [__LVGL Graphics Library__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lvgl2) renders User Interfaces and handles Touch Input

-   [__LVGL Terminal__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/terminal) is a Touchscreen App that we created with LVGL

-   [__WebAssembly Simulator__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lvgl4) previews Touchscreen Apps in the Web Browser

Today with NuttX for PinePhone, we can create __Touchscreen Apps__ that will work like a regular Smartphone App!

(But we're not yet a Complete Smartphone, we'll come back to this)

Let's talk about the Sensors inside PinePhone...

# Sensor Features

TODO: Pic above

-   [__Accelerometer and Gyroscope__](https://www.hackster.io/lupyuen/inside-a-smartphone-accelerometer-pinephone-with-nuttx-rtos-b92b58) will detect PinePhone motion and orientation

-   __Magnetometer, Light and Promixity Sensors__ are not yet supported

-   __Front and Rear Cameras__ are not supported

-   [__Power Management__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lcd#power-on-lcd-panel) is partially implemented. PinePhone's LCD Display and Sensors will power on correctly, but...

-   __Battery Charging and Low Power Mode__ are not done yet

![LTE Modem](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinephone2-roadmap5.jpg)

# LTE Modem

What makes PinePhone a Phone? It's the __LTE Modem__ inside PinePhone! (Pic above)

-   [__Outgoing Calls__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lte2#outgoing-phone-call) and [__Outgoing SMS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lte2#send-sms-in-pdu-mode) are OK, but...

-   __PCM Audio__ is not implemented, so we won't have audio

-   __Incoming Calls__ and __Incoming SMS__? Not yet

-   [__UART Interface__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lte2#send-at-commands) is ready for AT Commands

-   __USB Interface__ is not ready yet, so we won't have __GPS__

-   [__USB EHCI Controller__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/usb3) is partially done

-   __USB OTG Controller__? Not started
