# Touchscreen Features

We're incredibly fortunate that __PinePhone's Touchscreen__ runs OK with NuttX, after we built these features...

-   [__MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI)__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/dsi3) transmits pixel data to the [__LCD Panel__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lcd)

-   [__Allwinner Display Engine__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/de3) renders bitmap graphics and pushes the pixels over MIPI DSI

-   [__NuttX Framebuffer__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/fb) exposes the rendering API to NuttX Apps

-   [__I2C Touch Panel__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/touch2) detects Touch Input

-   [__LVGL Graphics Library__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lvgl2) renders User Interfaces and handles Touch Input

-   [__LVGL Terminal__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/terminal) is a Touchscreen App that we created with LVGL

-   [__WebAssembly Simulator__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lvgl4) previews Touchscreen Apps in the Web Browser

On NuttX for PinePhone, we can create __Touchscreen Apps__ that will work like a regular Smartphone App!

(But we're not yet a Complete Smartphone, we'll come back to this)

Let's talk about the Sensors inside PinePhone...
