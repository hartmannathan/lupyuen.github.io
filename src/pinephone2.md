2023 has been an awesome year for Apache NuttX RTOS on Pine64 PinePhone!

Let's talk about...

-   The features that we've implemented

-   What we'll do next

-   Why we might move to a RISC-V Tablet!

# NuttX on PinePhone Roadmap

TODO: Educational Exercise, 25 articles

Smartphones are incredibly complex gadgets. What if we could learn the internals of smartphones... By booting Apache NuttX RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) on our phone?

Over the past year, we have written a series of 24 articles explaining the inner workings of PinePhone, and how we implemented the smartphone features with Apache NuttX RTOS.

# Touchscreen Features

We're incredibly fortunate that __PinePhone's Touchscreen__ runs OK with NuttX, after we built these features (pic above)...

-   [__MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI)__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/dsi3) transmits pixel data to the [__LCD Panel__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lcd)

-   [__Allwinner Display Engine__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/de3) renders bitmap graphics and pushes the pixels over MIPI DSI

-   [__NuttX Framebuffer__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/fb) exposes the rendering API to NuttX Apps

-   [__I2C Touch Panel__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/touch2) detects Touch Input from the LCD Panel

-   [__LVGL Graphics Library__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lvgl2) renders User Interfaces and handles Touch Input

-   [__LVGL Terminal__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/terminal) is a Touchscreen App that we created with LVGL

-   [__WebAssembly Simulator__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lvgl4) previews Touchscreen Apps in the Web Browser

Today with NuttX for PinePhone, we can create __Touchscreen Apps__ that will work like a regular Smartphone App!

(But we're not yet a Complete Smartphone, we'll come back to this)

Let's talk about the Sensors inside PinePhone...

> ![Sensor Features](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinephone2-roadmap3.jpg)

# Sensor Features

TODO: Pic above

-   [__Accelerometer and Gyroscope__](https://www.hackster.io/lupyuen/inside-a-smartphone-accelerometer-pinephone-with-nuttx-rtos-b92b58) will detect PinePhone motion and orientation

-   __Magnetometer, Light and Promixity Sensors__ are not yet supported

-   __Front and Rear Cameras__ are not supported

-   [__Power Management__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lcd#power-on-lcd-panel) is partially implemented. PinePhone's LCD Display and Sensors will power on correctly, but...

-   __Battery Charging and Low Power Mode__ are not done yet

TODO

![LTE Modem](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinephone2-roadmap5.jpg)

# LTE Modem

_What makes PinePhone a Phone?_

It's the __LTE Modem__ inside PinePhone! (Pic above)

-   [__Outgoing Calls__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lte2#outgoing-phone-call) and [__Outgoing SMS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lte2#send-sms-in-pdu-mode) are OK, but...

-   __PCM Audio__ is not implemented, so we won't have audio

-   __Incoming Calls__ and __Incoming SMS__? Not yet

-   [__UART Interface__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lte2#send-at-commands) is ready for AT Commands

-   __USB Interface__ is not ready yet, so we won't have __GPS__

-   [__USB EHCI Controller__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/usb3) is partially done

-   __USB OTG Controller__? Not started

TODO

![Feature Phone](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinephone2-roadmap4.jpg)

# NuttX Feature Phone

_We've done quite a bit with the LTE Modem..._

_Are we a Feature Phone yet?_

TODO: Almost! Phone Calls + SMS, Pic above

-   We have created a [__Feature Phone UI__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lvgl4) as an LVGL Touchscreen App

-   That also runs in the [__Web Browser with WebAssembly__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lvgl4#run-lvgl-app-in-web-browser)

-   We need to integrate [__Outgoing Calls__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lte2#outgoing-phone-call) and [__Outgoing SMS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lte2#send-sms-in-pdu-mode) into our Feature Phone App

-   Though __PCM Audio__, __Incoming Calls__ and __Incoming SMS__ are still missing

It's sad that we haven't done PCM Audio... It would've been a terrific educational exercise. And we'd have a working Feature Phone!

TODO

![Smartphone](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinephone2-roadmap6.jpg)

# NuttX Smartphone

_OK we're almost a Feature Phone..._

_But are we a Smartphone yet?_

Sorry we're not quite ready to be a __Smartphone__ (pic above), because...

-   __Wireless Networking__ is completely missing: __Bluetooth LE__ and __WiFi__

    (Which will require plenty of coding)

-   __LoRa Networking__ with the [__LoRa Add-On Case__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/usb2#appendix-lora-communicator-for-pinephone-on-nuttx) will be really interesting, but sadly missing today

    (Mesh Networking with Meshtastic would be awesome)

-   __USB EHCI and OTG__ won't work either

If we had the energy (and patience), we should definitely do LoRa with Meshtastic on PinePhone!

TODO

# Core Features

_What else do we need for a Smartphone..._

_Have we missed any Core Features?_

TODO: Storage, pic above

-   __Multiple CPUs__ are not working yet, we're running on a Single Core today

-   __Memory Management__ will be needed for Virtual Memory and to protect the NuttX Kernel

-   __App Security__ needs to be implemented (similar to SELinux and AppArmor)

-   __eMMC and microSD Storage__ won't work (because we're running in RAM)

-   __GPU__ will be needed for serious graphics

-   [__PinePhone Emulator__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/unicorn) will be super helpful for testing the above features

Some of these features are probably supported by NuttX already. But we need to test thoroughly on PinePhone. (Hence the PinePhone Emulator)

![Rolling to RISC-V](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/pinephone2-roadmap6.jpg)

# Rolling to RISC-V

1.  _Fixing up NuttX for PinePhone..._

    _Surely we can do that for the next couple of months?_

    Allwinner A64 SoC was released in 2015... That's __8 years ago__!

    Before Allwinner A64 becomes obsolete, maybe we should consider a newer device?

    [(NuttX might still run on other Allwinner A64 handhelds)](https://retrododo.com/funnyplaying-retro-pixel-pocket/)

1.  _Like PinePhone Pro? Or PineTab 2?_

    Well that's more of the same same Arm64, innit?

    Just follow the exact same steps we've meticulously documented for NuttX on PinePhone...
    
    And NuttX will (probably) run on __any Arm64 Device__: iPhone, Samsung Phones, Tablets, Gaming Handhelds, ...

    [(Like the super-impressive Mobile Linux ecosystem)](https://postmarketos.org/)

1.  _So we're moving from Arm64 to RISC-V?_

    Yep! We have a fresh new opportunity to teach the __RISC-V 64-bit Architecture__ from scratch.

    And hopefully RISC-V Devices will still be around after 8 years!

1.  _We're porting NuttX to a RISC-V Phone?_

    Sadly there isn't a __RISC-V Phone__ yet.
    
    Thus we'll port NuttX to a RISC-V Tablet instead: [__PineTab-V__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineTab-V)

1.  _But PineTab-V isn't shipping yet!_

    That's OK, we'll begin by porting NuttX to the [__Star64 SBC__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/STAR64)

    Which runs on the same RISC-V SoC as PineTab-V: [__StarFive JH7110__](https://doc-en.rvspace.org/Doc_Center/jh7110.html)

    (Hopefully we have better docs and tidier code than the older Arm64 SoCs)

1.  _Hopping from Arm64 to RISC-V sounds like a major migration..._

    Actually we planned for this [__one year ago__](https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@nuttx.apache.org/msg08395.html).

    NuttX already runs OK on the (64-bit) [__QEMU RISC-V Emulator__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/tree/master/boards/risc-v/qemu-rv/rv-virt).
    
    So the migration might not be so challenging after all!

1.  _Why not FreeRTOS? Or Zephyr OS?_

    Our objective is to teach the internals of PinePhone using a very simple operating system. NuttX is super tiny, so it works just fine!

    __FreeRTOS__ is too bare-bones though. We would need to build a bunch of drivers from scratch: Display, Touch Input, USB, LVGL, Accelerometer, ... NuttX has many drivers that we need.

    __Zephyr OS__ has plenty of code contributed by large companies, it's better for writing commercial, industrial-grade firmware. But it might be too complex for learning about the internals of a smartphone.

1.  _Why Pine64 gadgets? Are they sponsored?_

    I bought my own PinePhone for porting NuttX. And I'll do the same for the RISC-V gadgets.

    Pine64 sells affordable phones and tablets for devs and learners. If you know of other similar companies, please lemme know! üôè

1.  _Why not collaborate with the Pine64 Community on Matrix or Discord?_

    I tried... But my sleeping hours got out of whack.

    (I'm in Singapore, my time zone is GMT+8 hours)

    [__Pine64 Forum__](https://forum.pine64.org/index.php) is probably the best place to catch me for a discussion.

1.  _Why not spend a bit more time on PinePhone or PinePhone Pro?_

    I'm already in my fifties and I have severe hypertension...

    I'm carefully planning my remaining days as IoT Techie and Educator :-)

    [(And possibly Sourdough Hacker)](https://lupyuen.codeberg.page/articles/sourdough.html)

1.  _What will happen to NuttX for PinePhone?_

    I'm still keen to promote NuttX as a teaching tool for learning the internals of PinePhone!

    If you know of any schools that might be interested, please lemme know! üôè
