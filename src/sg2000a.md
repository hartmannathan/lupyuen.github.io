# Daily Automated Testing for Milk-V Duo S RISC-V SBC (IKEA TRETAKT / Apache NuttX RTOS)

📝 _29 Jun 2024_

![TODO](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-title.jpg)

Last week we upstreamed [__Milk-V Duo S SBC__](TODO) to [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](TODO). (Based on [__Sophgo SG2000 RISC-V SoC__](TODO))

But NuttX Mainline [__changes every day__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/commits/master/). Will Milk-V Duo S suffer __"Software Bit Rot"__? And fail to boot NuttX someday?

Let's do __Daily Automated Testing__ for NuttX on a Milk-V Duo S. Yep on the Actual Physical SBC!

TODO

1.  Download the [Automated Daily Build](https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-sg2000#nuttx-automated-daily-build-for-sg2000) to TFTP Server

1.  Power on our SBC with an [IKEA Smart Power Plug via Home Assistant](https://github.com/lupyuen2/autotest-nuttx-sg2000#control-our-sbc-with-an-ikea-smart-power-plug-and-home-assistant)

1.  Our SBC boots the Daily Build over TFTP

1.  Capture the Automated Testing Log and write to the Release Notes

    [(See the __Automated Test Logs__)](https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-sg2000/tags)

# IKEA Smart Power Plug

Toughest Thing about our Daily Exercise: __Automagically Powering Up__ our SBC.

We hike to our neighbourhood IKEA Store and buy...

- [__IKEA TRETAKT Smart Power Plug__](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/tretakt-plug-with-remote-control-smart-30569726/)

  (Which talks Zigbee, not WiFi)

- [__IKEA DIRIGERA Zigbee Hub__](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/dirigera-hub-for-smart-products-white-smart-50503409/)

  (Which talks Ethernet, not WiFi!)

- [__USB Charger and USB-C Cable__](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/search/?q=usb)

  (To power up our SBC)

We add the Smart Power Plug to the [__IKEA Home Smart App__](https://www.ikea.com/sg/en/customer-service/product-support/smart-home-dirigera-hub/). And we name it __"SG2000 Power"__...

![IKEA Smart Power Plug in IKEA Home Smart App](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-ikea.jpg)

_But IKEA doesn't provide a Public API for their gadgets!_

Yeah our script can't directly control the power plug sigh. That's why we...

1.  Add the IKEA Smart Power Plug to [__Google Assistant__](https://www.ikea.com/nl/en/customer-service/knowledge/articles/c916g4b0-c602-4g65-9c4e-b40f801g43dc.html)

    (On our Android Phone)

1.  Eventually we control the IKEA Smart Power Plug via the [__Google Assistant SDK__](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/01cff0d4ca225984ca8fd0d999d7c76d)

    (Which sounds kinda tedious)

1.  So instead we control Google Assistant SDK thru [__Home Assistant__](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/01cff0d4ca225984ca8fd0d999d7c76d)

    (Just point and click yay!)

1.  __For macOS:__ We run Home Assistant in a [__Docker Container__](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/03a7cc8702085c70893e157d8c3ca3f8)

    [__(Rancher Desktop)__](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/03a7cc8702085c70893e157d8c3ca3f8)

![Controlling an IKEA Smart Power Plug with Home Assistant](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-flow.jpg)

# Call the Home Assistant API

_How will Home Assistant control Google Assistant to control our Smart Power Plug?_

Assume we've added the [__Smart Power Plug__](https://www.ikea.com/nl/en/customer-service/knowledge/articles/c916g4b0-c602-4g65-9c4e-b40f801g43dc.html) to Google Assistant. And named the Smart Power Plug as __"SG2000 Power"__.

We create an __Automation__ in Home Assistant...

![Create an Automation in Home Assistant](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-ha1.jpg)

Inside our Automation: Add an __Action__...

![Create an Automation in Home Assistant](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-ha2.jpg)

Select the [__Google Assistant SDK__](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/01cff0d4ca225984ca8fd0d999d7c76d). Enter the command: __"SG2000 Power On"__...

![Create an Automation in Home Assistant](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-ha3.jpg)

Save it as an Automation named __"SG2000 Power On"__...

> ![Create an Automation in Home Assistant](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-ha4.png)

_But how do we Power On our SBC from our Automated Test Script?_

We call the [__Home Assistant REST API__](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/) with a [__Long-Lived Access Token__](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/how-to-get-long-lived-access-token/162159/5), to trigger our Automation: [test.sh](https://github.com/lupyuen2/autotest-nuttx-sg2000/blob/main/scripts/test.sh#L54-L80)

```bash
## Long-Lived Access Token from
## http://localhost:8123/profile/security
token=xxxx

## Power Off our SBC:
## Trigger the Automation "sg2000_power_off"
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_id": "automation.sg2000_power_off"}' \
  http://localhost:8123/api/services/automation/trigger

## Power On our SBC:
## Trigger the Automation "sg2000_power_on"
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_id": "automation.sg2000_power_on"}' \
  http://localhost:8123/api/services/automation/trigger
```

_Doesn't the USB UART Adapter supply a tiny bit of power to our SBC?_

Yeah enough power to light up the SBC, but not enough to power up the SBC totally.

Thus our SBC will __glow errily red at night__, even though the power is off. (I drape a hand towel so it won't haunt my sleep)

[(Or maybe we power up __Another SBC__ to test Our SBC)](https://github.com/lupyuen/remote-bl602/blob/main/scripts/task.sh#L55-L71)

![Power On our SBC from our Automated Test Script](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-title.jpg)

# Download the Daily Build

_What will we boot and test on our SBC?_

We'll download the [__Daily Build of NuttX Mainline__](https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-sg2000#nuttx-automated-daily-build-for-sg2000) (for Milk-V Duo S): [test.sh](https://github.com/lupyuen2/autotest-nuttx-sg2000/blob/main/scripts/test.sh#L6-L83)

```bash
##  Build Prefix is "nuttx-sg2000"
##  Build Date is today (YYYY-MM-DD)
BUILD_PREFIX=nuttx-sg2000
BUILD_DATE=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')

## Download the NuttX Build for today
wget -q \
  https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-sg2000/releases/download/$BUILD_PREFIX-$BUILD_DATE/nuttx.zip \
  -O /tmp/nuttx.zip
pushd /tmp
unzip -o nuttx.zip
popd

## Copy the NuttX Image to our TFTP Server.
## Rename as `Image-sg2000`
scp /tmp/Image \
  tftpserver:/tftpfolder/Image-sg2000

## Run the Automated Test.
## For Linux: Change `nuttx.exp` to `-c nuttx.exp`
script /tmp/test.log \
  nuttx.exp
```

_We're using a TFTP Server?_

Yep our SBC will boot the NuttX Image that's copied to our [__TFTP Server__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/sg2000#boot-nuttx-over-tftp).

Our SBC needs a [__MicroSD Card with U-Boot Bootloader__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/sg2000#download-the-linux-microsd). And some special [__U-Boot Commands for TFTP__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/sg2000#boot-nuttx-over-tftp).

(That will run automatically thanks to __`saveenv`__)

See the __nuttx.exp__ from above? Let's talk about the Automated Test Script...

![Expect Script for Testing NuttX over a USB Serial Port ](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-flow2.jpg)

# Automated Test Script

_What's inside our Automated Test Script: nuttx.exp?_

This is an [__Expect Tcl Script__](https://linux.die.net/man/1/expect) that will send NuttX Commands over the USB Serial Port to our SBC: [nuttx.exp](https://github.com/lupyuen2/autotest-nuttx-sg2000/blob/main/scripts/nuttx.exp)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/expect
## Expect Script for Testing NuttX over a USB Serial Port 

## Wait at most 300 seconds
set timeout 300

## For every 1 character sent, wait 0.001 milliseconds
set send_slow {1 0.001}

## Connect to SBC over USB Serial Port at 115.2 kbps
spawn screen /dev/tty.usbserial-0001 115200

## Wake up the NSH Shell
send -s "\r"

## Wait for the NSH Prompt and enter `uname -a`
expect "nsh> "
send -s "uname -a\r"

## Wait for the NSH Prompt and enter `ostest`
expect "nsh> "
send -s "ostest\r"

## Check the `ostest` response
expect {

  ## If we see this message, exit normally
  "ostest_main: Exiting with status 0" { 

    ## Terminate the session: Ctrl-A k y
    send "\x01ky"
    puts "===== Test OK\n"
    exit 0 
  }

  ## If timeout, exit with an error
  timeout { 

    ## Terminate the session: Ctrl-A k y
    send "\x01ky"
    puts "===== Error: Test Failed\n"
    exit 1 
  }
}
```

[__OSTest__](TODO) will run a whole bunch of NuttX Tests, thoroughly exercising everything and vetting our physical proficiency.

![Automated Test Log uploaded to GitHub Release Notes](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-log.jpg)

# Upload the Test Log

_OK but where's the evidence of our Daily Test?_

Every day, everything gets meticulously recorded into the [__GitHub Release Notes__](https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-sg2000/tags)...

```bash
## Download the latest NuttX Build for 2024-06-21
+ wget -q https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-sg2000/releases/download/nuttx-sg2000-2024-06-21/nuttx.zip -O /tmp/nuttx.zip

## Run NuttX OSTest
nsh> ostest
...
user_main: Exiting
ostest_main: Exiting with status 0
===== Test OK
```

_Whoa that's plenty of logs. How did they get there?_

We ran a script to __Upload the Test Log__ into the GitHub Release Notes: [upload.sh](https://github.com/lupyuen2/autotest-nuttx-sg2000/blob/main/scripts/upload.sh#L66-L74)

```bash
## Upload the Test Log to the
## GitHub Release Notes.
## `release.tag` looks like `nuttx-sg2000-2024-06-21`
gh release edit \
  `cat /tmp/release.tag` \
  --notes-file /tmp/release2.log \
  --repo lupyuen/nuttx-sg2000
```

_We run all these scripts every day?_

Actually we run the scripts [__every 10 minutes__](https://github.com/lupyuen2/autotest-nuttx-sg2000/blob/main/scripts/task.sh#L54-L66), waiting for the [__Latest Daily Build__](https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-sg2000#nuttx-automated-daily-build-for-sg2000).

Which triggers our Smart Power Plug and Automated Test Script.

```bash
## Run the Daily Automated Test
script /tmp/release.log \
  scripts/test.sh

## Upload the Test Log to GitHub Release Notes
scripts/upload.sh

## OR: Do this to run the Automated Test automatically whenever there's a Daily Build
scripts/task.sh
```

# What's Next

_OK thanks but why not run the Daily Automated Test on a Software Emulator? (Instead of Real Hardware)_

Oh yes we're [__doing that too__](https://github.com/lupyuen2/sg2000-emulator)! Please join me in the next article on __SG2000 Emulator__.

Many Thanks to my [__GitHub Sponsors__](https://github.com/sponsors/lupyuen) (and the awesome NuttX Community) for supporting my work! This article wouldn't have been possible without your support.
