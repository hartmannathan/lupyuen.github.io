# Daily Automated Testing for Milk-V Duo S RISC-V SBC (IKEA TRETAKT / Apache NuttX RTOS)

üìù _29 Jun 2024_

![TODO](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-title.jpg)

Last week we upstreamed Milk-V Duo S SBC to Apache NuttX RTOS.

(Based on Sophgo SG2000 RISC-V SoC)

But NuttX Mainline [__changes every day__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/commits/master/).

Can we be sure that Milk-V Duo S won't suffer __"Software Bit Rot"__? And fail to boot NuttX someday?

Let's do __Daily Automated Testing__ for NuttX on a Milk-V Duo S. Yep on the Actual Physical SBC!

# Control our SBC with an IKEA Smart Power Plug and Home Assistant

Toughest Thing about our Daily Exercise: __Automagically Powering Up__ our SBC.

We hike to our neighbourhood IKEA Store and buy...

- [__IKEA TRETAKT Smart Power Plug__](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/tretakt-plug-with-remote-control-smart-30569726/)

  (Which talks Zigbee, not WiFi)

- [__IKEA DIRIGERA Zigbee Hub__](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/dirigera-hub-for-smart-products-white-smart-50503409/)

  (Which talks Ethernet, not WiFi!)

- [__USB Charger and USB-C Cable__](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/search/?q=usb)

  (To power up our SBC)

We add the Smart Power Plug to the [__IKEA Home Smart App__](https://www.ikea.com/sg/en/customer-service/product-support/smart-home-dirigera-hub/). And we name it __"SG2000 Power"__...

![IKEA Smart Power Plug in IKEA Home Smart App](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-ikea.jpg)

_But IKEA doesn't provide a Public API for their gadgets!_

Yeah our script can't directly control the power plug sigh. That's why we...

1.  Add the IKEA Smart Power Plug to [__Google Assistant__](https://www.ikea.com/nl/en/customer-service/knowledge/articles/c916g4b0-c602-4g65-9c4e-b40f801g43dc.html)

    (On our Android Phone)

1.  Eventually we control the IKEA Smart Power Plug via the [__Google Assistant SDK__](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/01cff0d4ca225984ca8fd0d999d7c76d)

    (Which sounds kinda tedious)

1.  So instead we control Google Assistant SDK with [__Home Assistant__](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/01cff0d4ca225984ca8fd0d999d7c76d)

    (Just point and click yay!)

1.  __For macOS:__ We run Home Assistant in a [__Docker Container__](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/03a7cc8702085c70893e157d8c3ca3f8)

    [__(Rancher Desktop)__](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/03a7cc8702085c70893e157d8c3ca3f8)

_How will Home Assistant control Google Assistant to control our Smart Power Plug?_

Assume we've added the [__Smart Power Plug__](https://www.ikea.com/nl/en/customer-service/knowledge/articles/c916g4b0-c602-4g65-9c4e-b40f801g43dc.html) to Google Assistant. And named the Smart Power Plug as __"SG2000 Power"__.

We create an __Automation__ in Home Assistant...

![Create an Automation in Home Assistant](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-ha1.jpg)

Inside our Automation: Add an __Action__...

![Create an Automation in Home Assistant](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-ha2.jpg)

Select the [__Google Assistant SDK__](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/01cff0d4ca225984ca8fd0d999d7c76d). Enter the command: __"SG2000 Power On"__...

![Create an Automation in Home Assistant](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-ha3.jpg)

Save it as an Automation named __"SG2000 Power On"__...

![Create an Automation in Home Assistant](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/sg2000a-ha4.png)

_But how do we Power On our SBC from our Automated Test Script?_

We call the [__Home Assistant REST API__](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/) with a [__Long-Lived Access Token__](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/how-to-get-long-lived-access-token/162159/5), to trigger our Automation: [test.sh](https://github.com/lupyuen2/autotest-nuttx-sg2000/blob/main/scripts/test.sh#L54-L80)

```bash
## Long-Lived Access Token from
## http://localhost:8123/profile/security
token=xxxx

## Power Off our SBC:
## Trigger the Automation "sg2000_power_off"
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_id": "automation.sg2000_power_off"}' \
  http://localhost:8123/api/services/automation/trigger

## Power On our SBC:
## Trigger the Automation "sg2000_power_on"
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_id": "automation.sg2000_power_on"}' \
  http://localhost:8123/api/services/automation/trigger
```

_Doesn't the USB UART Adapter supply a tiny bit of power to our SBC?_

Yeah enough power to light up the SBC, but not enough to power up the SBC totally.

Thus our SBC will glow at night, even though the power is off. (I drape a hand towel so it won't bother my sleep)

# Download the Daily Build

_What will we boot and test on our SBC?_

We'll download the [__Daily Build of NuttX Mainline__](https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-sg2000#nuttx-automated-daily-build-for-sg2000) (for Milk-V Duo S): [test.sh](https://github.com/lupyuen2/autotest-nuttx-sg2000/blob/main/scripts/test.sh#L6-L50)

```bash
##  Build Prefix is "nuttx-sg2000"
##  Build Date is today (YYYY-MM-DD)
##  USB Device is /dev/tty.usbserial-0001
BUILD_PREFIX=nuttx-sg2000
BUILD_DATE=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')
USB_DEVICE=/dev/tty.usbserial-0001

## Download the NuttX Build for today
wget -q \
  https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-sg2000/releases/download/$BUILD_PREFIX-$BUILD_DATE/nuttx.zip \
  -O /tmp/nuttx.zip
pushd /tmp
unzip -o nuttx.zip
popd

## Copy NuttX Image to TFTP Server
scp /tmp/Image \

# Automated Testing of Apache NuttX RTOS on Sophgo SG2000 SoC / Milk-V Duo S SBC

TODO

We are now running Daily Automated Testing of [Apache NuttX RTOS](https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-sg2000) on a Real Milk-V Duo S SBC (Sophgo SG2000 SoC)...

1.  Download the [Automated Daily Build](https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-sg2000#nuttx-automated-daily-build-for-sg2000) to TFTP Server

1.  Power on our SBC with an [IKEA Smart Power Plug via Home Assistant](https://github.com/lupyuen2/autotest-nuttx-sg2000#control-our-sbc-with-an-ikea-smart-power-plug-and-home-assistant)

1.  Our SBC boots the Daily Build over TFTP

1.  Capture the Automated Testing Log and write to the Release Notes

Like this...

```bash
## Run the Daily Automated Testing
script /tmp/release.log scripts/test.sh

## Upload the Test Log to GitHub Release Notes
scripts/upload.sh

## OR: Do this to run the Automated Test automatically whenever there's a Daily Build
scripts/task.sh
```

[(See the Automated Test Logs)](https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-sg2000/releases)

Here are the Automated Testing Scripts...

- Automated Task: [task.sh](scripts/task.sh)
- Test NuttX on SBC: [test.sh](scripts/test.sh)
- Upload Test Log: [upload.sh](scripts/upload.sh)
- Expect Script: [nuttx.exp](scripts/nuttx.exp)

# What's Next

TODO

_Why not run the Daily Automated Test on a Software Emulator? (Instead of Real Hardware)_

Oh yes we're doing that too! Please join me in the next article on __SG2000 Emulator__.
