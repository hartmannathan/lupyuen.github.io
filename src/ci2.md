# Your very own Build Farm for Apache NuttX RTOS

![TODO](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/ci2-title.jpg)

[__Refurbished Ubuntu PCs__](TODO) have become quite affordable ($??? pic above). What if we could turn them into a __(Low-Cost) Build Farm__ for [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](TODO)?

_What if we could run the CI Jobs on our own Ubuntu PCs? Without any help from GitHub Actions?_

I'm experimenting with a "Build Farm" at home (refurbished PC) that __runs NuttX CI Jobs all day__ non-stop 24 x 7:
- Check out `master` branch of `nuttx`, run CI Job `arm-01`
- Wait for `arm-01` to complete (roughly 1.5 hours)
- Check out `master` branch of `nuttx`, run CI Job `arm-02`
- Wait for `arm-02` to complete (roughly 1.5 hours)
- Do the same until `arm-14`, then loop back to `arm-01`
- [Here's the CI Output Log](https://gist.github.com/nuttxpr)

How does it work?
- [run-job.sh](https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-release/blob/main/run-job.sh) will run a single CI Job, by calling the NuttX Docker Image, which is called by...
- [run-ci.sh](https://github.com/lupyuen/nuttx-release/blob/main/run-ci.sh) looping forever through `arm-01` to `arm-14`, running the job, searching for errors and uploading the logs
