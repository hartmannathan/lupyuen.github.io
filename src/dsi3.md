# NuttX RTOS for PinePhone: MIPI Display Serial Interface

üìù _18 Dec 2022_

![TODO](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/dsi3-title.jpg)

__Pine64 PinePhone__ will soon support the rendering of graphics on the LCD Display... When we boot the official release of __Apache NuttX RTOS__!

We're building the __NuttX Display Driver__ for PinePhone in small chunks, starting with the driver for __MIPI Display Serial Interface__.

In this article we'll learn...

-   What's needed for a __Complete Display Driver__ for PinePhone

-   How our driver for __MIPI Display Serial Interface__ fits into the grand plan

-   How we're __building the missing pieces__ of the PinePhone Display Driver

-   Why most parts of the Display Driver are in the __Zig Programming Language__

# Complete Display Driver for PinePhone

Through __Reverse Engineering__ (and plenty of experimenting), we discovered that these steps are needed for a __Complete Display Driver__ for PinePhone...
