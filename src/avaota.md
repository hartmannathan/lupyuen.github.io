_Why are we doing this?_

- Anyone porting NuttX from __QEMU to Real SBC__? This walkthrough shall be mighty helpful!

TODO: Before Porting NuttX, we observe our SBC and its Natural Behaviour: How does it boot Linux?

I ported NuttX to a simpler A527 board, the Avaota-A1 SBC by PINE64 ($55): https://pine64.com/product/yuzuki-avaota-a1-single-board-computer-4gb-32gb/

Avaota-A1 SBC is Open Source Hardware (CERN OHL Licensed). PINE64 sells it today, maybe we'll see more manufacturers with the same design: https://github.com/AvaotaSBC/Avaota-A1

I think NuttX on Avaota-A1 (Allwinner A527) will be super interesting because:

(1) It's one of the first ports of Arm64 in NuttX Kernel Build (NXP i.MX93 might be another?)

(2) We'll run it as PR Test Bot for Validating Arm64 PRs

(3) PR Test Bot will be fully automated thanks to SDWire MicroSD Mux: https://lupyuen.org/articles/testbot3.html

Next article I'll explain how I ported NuttX from QEMU Arm64 (knsh) to Avaota-A1, completed within 24 hours.

Why?
