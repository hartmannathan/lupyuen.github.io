# Star64 JH7110 + NuttX RTOS: RISC-V Privilege Levels and UART Registers

üìù _23 Jul 2023_

In this article we'll boot a tiny bit of [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html) on the [__Pine64 Star64__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/STAR64) 64-bit RISC-V Single-Board Computer.

(Based on [__StarFive JH7110__](https://doc-en.rvspace.org/Doc_Center/jh7110.html) SoC)

_What's NuttX?_

[__Apache NuttX__](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html) is a __Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)__ that runs on many kinds of devices, from 8-bit to 64-bit.

# RISC-V Privilege Levels

TODO

_What's this Privilege Level?_

RISC-V Machine Code runs at three __Privilege Levels__...

- __M: Machine Mode__ (Most powerful)

- __S: Supervisor Mode__ (Less powerful)

- __U: User Mode__ (Least powerful)

NuttX on Star64 runs in __Supervisor Mode__. Which doesn't allow access to [__Machine-Mode CSR Registers__](https://five-embeddev.com/riscv-isa-manual/latest/machine.html). (Pic above)

Remember this?

```text
/* Load the Hart ID (CPU ID) */
csrr a0, mhartid
```

The __"`m`"__ in [__`mhartid`__](https://five-embeddev.com/riscv-isa-manual/latest/machine.html#hart-id-register-mhartid) signifies that it's a __Machine-Mode Register__.

That's why NuttX fails to read the Hart ID!

_What runs in Machine Mode?_

[__OpenSBI (Supervisor Binary Interface)__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/linux#opensbi-supervisor-binary-interface) is the first thing that boots on Star64.

It runs in __Machine Mode__ and starts the U-Boot Bootloader.

[(More about __OpenSBI__)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/linux#opensbi-supervisor-binary-interface)

_What about U-Boot Bootloader?_

[__U-Boot Bootloader__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/linux#u-boot-bootloader-for-star64) runs in __Supervisor Mode__. And starts NuttX, also in Supervisor Mode.

Thus __OpenSBI is the only thing__ that runs in Machine Mode. And can access the Machine-Mode Registers. (Pic above)

[(More about __U-Boot__)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/linux#u-boot-bootloader-for-star64)

_QEMU doesn't have this problem?_

Because QEMU runs NuttX in (super-powerful) __Machine Mode__!
