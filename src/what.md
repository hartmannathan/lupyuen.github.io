Over the past 5 months, we ported a different kind of Operating System to [__Pine64 PinePhone__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone)... [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/)

(RTOS for Real-Time Operating System)

Let's talk about __NuttX for PinePhone__: What is it? Why are we doing this? How will we use it?

# Smaller and Simpler

_What's Apache NuttX RTOS?_

Think Linux, Ubuntu, Manjaro, Arch, ... But a lot __smaller and simpler__.

NuttX is a __tiny operating system__ (10 MB) that boots on a __micro SD Card__ and provides a Command-Line Interface. (Pic above)

TODO: (Compiles in XXX seconds on a 10-year-old MacBook Pro)

_Why "Real-Time"?_

It's a __Real-Time Operating System__ (RTOS) because NuttX was created for __tiny microcontrollers__: STM32, nRF52, BL602, ESP32, ...

Which won't run a General Purpose Operating System. (Like Linux)

So now we have "upsized" NuttX for __Arm64 Smartphones__.

_Is NuttX a Daily Driver for PinePhone?_

Not yet, NuttX won't make phone calls and send text messages. It might become a __Daily Driver someday__... If we put a lot of work into it.

It's probably more suitable for __Education__ right now: For learning what happens when a Smartphone boots, how it renders graphics on the LCD Display.

And for folks who wish to tinker __Bare Metal__ on PinePhone.

(Turning NuttX into Daily Driver might be an interesting project for students!)

_Does NuttX support X11? Wayland?_

Nope, only [__LVGL__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/fb#lvgl-graphics-library) is supported. (Pic at the top)

And we're still working on the Touch Input.

_Will it run Linux apps?_

Sadly nope. But NuttX is based on [__POSIX__](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/introduction/inviolables.html#strict-posix-compliance), so some apps might compile for NuttX.

Let's talk about NuttX for Learners...

[_NuttX Display Driver for PinePhone_](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/dsi3#complete-display-driver-for-pinephone)

# Smartphone Education

_Is NuttX good for learning the internals of Smartphones?_

TODO: Check out the [__13 articles__](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-nuttx#apache-nuttx-rtos-for-pinephone) covering everything inside-out about NuttX on PinePhone: GPIO, UART, Framebuffer, LCD Panel, ...

TODO: And esoteric topics too: Display Engine, MIPI Display Serial Interface, Power Management Integrated Circuit, Reduced Serial Bus, Generic Interrupt Controller, ...

(Great for Bedtime Reading!)

_So you envision a classroom of students, cracking open their PinePhones to experiment with NuttX?_

Yeah possibly? I taught Operating Systems in school... I wished we could use our phones as a __Teaching Tool__.

(For Retro Fans: NuttX is probably more [__MINIX__](https://www.minix3.org/) than Linux)

_Can we take the NuttX source code and build a super duper Custom PinePhone? (Maybe sell it?)_

Yep feel free to take the code and do everything with it! The source code is [__Apache Licensed__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/LICENSE).

But please __drop us a note__ to tell us if you're using the code in your project...  We're curious to know if anyone finds our work useful!

_Where did the code come from?_

We created the code based on the official docs for the __Allwinner A64 SoC__. But some parts of Allwinner A64 are poorly documented. (Like the Display Engine)

A sizeable chunk of our code was [__Reverse Engineered__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/de#appendix-initialising-the-allwinner-a64-display-engine) from the p-boot Bootloader, by observing which Hardware Registers it uses.

The __NuttX Community__ is now adding new drivers for Allwinner A64 SoC, like for I2C.

[(We welcome your contribution to NuttX!)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/pr)

_Is Apache paying you to do this?_

I'm proud to volunteer as a member of the Apache NuttX __Project Management Committee__.

I'm not paid by Apache Software Foundation. But I'm extremely grateful to my [__GitHub Sponsors__](https://github.com/sponsors/lupyuen) for supporting my work on PinePhone Education!

If we're keen to build and boot NuttX on our PinePhone, please read on...

[_USB Serial Debug Cable for PinePhone_](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Serial_console)

# Build NuttX

Here's what we need for running NuttX on PinePhone...

-   __Pine64 PinePhone__

    (sorry not PinePhone Pro)

-   USB Serial Debug Cable
-   microSD Card

TODO

Serial Console

A [PinePhone Serial Debug Cable](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Serial_console)
is required to run NuttX on PinePhone.

On PinePhone, set the [Privacy Switch 6 (Headphone)](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Privacy_switch_configuration)
to __Off__.

Connect PinePhone to our computer with the Serial Debug Cable.
On our computer, start a Serial Terminal and connect to the USB Serial Port
at __115.2 kbps__.

NuttX will appear in the Serial Console when it boots on PinePhone.

TODO: Download `Image.gz` here

ARM64 Toolchain

Before building NuttX for PinePhone, download the ARM64 Toolchain for
__AArch64 Bare-Metal Target__ `aarch64-none-elf` from
[Arm GNU Toolchain Downloads](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads).

(Skip the section for Beta Releases)

Add the downloaded toolchain `gcc-arm-...-aarch64-none-elf/bin`
to the `PATH` Environment Variable.

Check the ARM64 Toolchain:

```bash
aarch64-none-elf-gcc -v
```

To build NuttX for PinePhone...

TODO: install the prerequisites

TODO: clone the git repositories `nuttx` and `apps`

Configure the NuttX Project...

```bash
cd nuttx
tools/configure.sh pinephone:lcd
make menuconfig
```

TODO: Select LVGL App

Build the NuttX Project...

```bash
make
cp nuttx.bin Image
rm -f Image.gz
gzip Image
```

This produces the file `Image.gz`, which will be copied to PinePhone in the next step.

If the build fails with the error `token "@" is not valid in preprocessor`,
[apply this patch](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/pull/7284/commits/518b0eb31cb66f25b590ae9a79ab16c319b96b94#diff-12291efd8a0ded1bc38bad733d99e4840ae5112b465c04287f91ba5169612c73)
to `gcc-arm-none-eabi/arm-none-eabi/include/_newlib_version.h`
in the ARM64 Toolchain.

# Boot NuttX

TODO

Booting

NuttX boots on PinePhone via a microSD Card. To prepare the microSD Card, download the
__PinePhone Jumpdrive Image__ `pine64-pinephone.img.xz` from
[dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive](https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Jumpdrive/releases)

Write the downloaded image to a microSD Card with
[Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

Copy the file `Image.gz` from the previous section
and overwrite the file on the microSD Card. (Pic above)

Check that PinePhone is connected to our computer via a
[Serial Debug Cable](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Serial_console) at 115.2 kbps.

[Privacy Switch 6 (Headphone)](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone#Privacy_switch_configuration)
should be set to __Off__.

Insert the microSD Card into PinePhone and power up PinePhone.

NuttX boots on PinePhone and NuttShell (nsh) appears in the Serial Console.

To see the available commands in NuttShell...

```bash
help
```

To run the LVGL Demo App...

```bash
lvgldemo
```
