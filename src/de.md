_PinePhone rendering Mandelbrot Set on Apache NuttX RTOS_

In the last 2 articles we talked about [__Pine64 PinePhone__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone) (pic above) and how we built a __Display Driver__ for PinePhone's MIPI Display Serial Interface...

-   [__"Understanding PinePhone's Display (MIPI DSI)"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/dsi)

-   [__"NuttX RTOS for PinePhone: Display Driver in Zig"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/dsi2)

But our PinePhone Display Driver __isn't complete__... It won't render any graphics!

Today we'll learn about the missing bits in our Display Driver...

-   What's the __Display Engine (DE)__ inside PinePhone

-   What's the __Timing Controller (TCON0)__ and how it controls PinePhone's LCD Display

-   How we call DE and TCON0 to __render graphics__

-   How our __PinePhone Display Driver__ shall support DE and TCON0

_Why are we doing this?_

We're now porting [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot) to PinePhone.

TODO

Let's continue the journey from our __NuttX Porting Journal__...
