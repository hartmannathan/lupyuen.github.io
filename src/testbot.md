# Test Bot for Pull Requests ... Tested on Real Hardware (Apache NuttX RTOS / Oz64 SG2000 RISC-V SBC)

![Test Bot for Pull Requests ... Tested on Real Hardware (Apache NuttX RTOS / Oz64 SG2000 RISC-V SBC)](https://lupyuen.org/images/testbot-title.jpg)

We're [__Making Things Better__](https://lists.apache.org/thread/mn4l1tmr6fj46o2y9vvrmfcrgyo48s5d) (and making better things) with [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](TODO).

Our new __Test Bot for Pull Requests__ will allow a [__Pull Request Comment__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/pull/15756#issuecomment-2641277894) to trigger a __NuttX Build + Test__ on Real Hardware. For example, this PR Comment...

```bash
@nuttxpr test oz64:nsh
```

Will trigger our PR Test Bot to download the PR Code and test it on [__Oz64 SG2000 RISC-V SBC__](TODO). (Pic above)

Super helpful for __Testing Pull Requests__ before Merging. But might have [__Security Implications__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/issues/15731#issuecomment-2628647886). (We'll come back to this)
