![Emulating Arm64 Machine Code in Unicorn](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/unicorn-title.jpg)

[_Emulating Arm64 Machine Code in Unicorn_](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/bc5643dea66c70f57a150955a12884f695acf1a4/src/main.rs#L1-L55)

[__Unicorn__](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/) is a lightweight __CPU Emulator Framework__ based on [__QEMU__](http://www.qemu.org/).

(Programmable with C, Rust, Python and [__many other languages__](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/tree/master/bindings))

We're porting a new operating system [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/what) to [__Pine64 PinePhone__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone). And I wondered...

_To make PinePhone testing easier... Can we emulate Arm64 PinePhone with Unicorn Emulator?_

Let's find out! In this article we'll call __Unicorn Emulator__ to...

-   __Emulate Arm64__ Machine Code

-   __Attach Hooks__ to intercept Memory Access and Code Execution

-   __Boot Apache NuttX RTOS__ in the emulator

-   __Simulate the UART Controller__ for PinePhone

-   __Track an Exception__ in Arm64 Memory Management

We'll do all this in __basic Rust__, instead of classic C.

(That's because I'm too old to write meticulous C... But I'm OK to get nagged by Rust Compiler if I miss something!)

We begin by emulating some machine code...

# Emulate Arm64 Machine Code

Suppose we wish to emulate this __Arm64 Machine Code__...

```rust
// Start Address: 0x10000

// str  w11, [x13], #0
AB 05 00 B8

// ldrb w15, [x13], #0
AF 05 40 38

// End Address: 0x10008
```

With these __Arm64 Register Values__...

| Register | Value |
|:--------:|:------|
| `X11` | `0x12345678`
| `X13` | `0x10008`
| `X15` | `0x33`

Which means...

1.  __Store `X11`__ (value __`0x12345678`__)

    Into the address referenced by __`X13`__

    (Address __`0x10008`__)

1.  __Load `X15`__ as a __Single Byte__

    From the address referenced by __`X13`__

    (Address __`0x10008`__)

1.  Which sets __`X15`__ to __`0x78`__

    (Because __`0x10008`__ contains byte __`0x78`__)

    [(__`X`__ Registers are __64-bit__, __`W`__ Registers are __32-bit__)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102374/0100/Registers-in-AArch64---general-purpose-registers)

This is how we __call Unicorn Emulator__ to emulate the Arm64 Machine Code: [main.rs](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/bc5643dea66c70f57a150955a12884f695acf1a4/src/main.rs#L1-L55)

```rust
use unicorn_engine::{Unicorn, RegisterARM64};
use unicorn_engine::unicorn_const::{Arch, Mode, Permission};

fn main() {
  // Arm64 Memory Address where emulation starts
  const ADDRESS: u64 = 0x10000;

  // Arm64 Machine Code for the above address
  let arm64_code: Vec<u8> = vec![
    0xab, 0x05, 0x00, 0xb8,  // str w11,  [x13], #0
    0xaf, 0x05, 0x40, 0x38,  // ldrb w15, [x13], #0
  ];
```

We begin by defining the __Arm64 Machine Code__.

Then we __initialise the emulator__...

```rust
  // Init Emulator in Arm64 mode
  let mut unicorn = Unicorn::new(
    Arch::ARM64,
    Mode::LITTLE_ENDIAN
  ).expect("failed to init Unicorn");

  // Magical horse mutates to bird
  let emu = &mut unicorn;
```

Unicorn needs some __Emulated Memory__ to run our code.

We map __2MB of Executable Memory__...

```rust
  // Map 2MB of Executable Memory at 0x10000
  // for Arm64 Machine Code
  emu.mem_map(
    ADDRESS,          // Address is 0x10000
    2 * 1024 * 1024,  // Size is 2MB
    Permission::ALL   // Read, Write and Execute Access
  ).expect("failed to map code page");
```

And we __populate the Executable Memory__ with our Arm64 Machine Code...

```rust
  // Write Arm64 Machine Code to emulated Executable Memory
  emu.mem_write(
    ADDRESS,     // Address is 0x10000
    &arm64_code  // Arm64 Machine Code
  ).expect("failed to write instructions");
```

We __set the Arm64 Registers__: X11, X13 and X15...

```rust
  // Register Values
  const X11: u64 = 0x12345678;    // X11 value
  const X13: u64 = ADDRESS + 0x8; // X13 value
  const X15: u64 = 0x33;          // X15 value
  
  // Set the Arm64 Registers
  emu.reg_write(RegisterARM64::X11, X11)
    .expect("failed to set X11");
  emu.reg_write(RegisterARM64::X13, X13)
    .expect("failed to set X13");
  emu.reg_write(RegisterARM64::X15, X15)
    .expect("failed to set X15");
```

We __start the emulator__...

```rust
  // Emulate Arm64 Machine Code
  let err = emu.emu_start(
    ADDRESS,  // Begin Address is 0x10000
    ADDRESS + arm64_code.len() as u64,  // End Address is 0x10008
    0,  // No Timeout
    0   // Unlimited number of instructions
  );

  // Print the Emulator Error
  println!("err={:?}", err);
```

Finally we __read Register X15__ and verify the result...

```rust
  // Read the X15 Register
  assert_eq!(
    emu.reg_read(RegisterARM64::X15),  // Register X15
    Ok(0x78)  // Expected Result
  );
}
```

And we're done!

Unicorn is hunky dory!

Let's talk about Memory-Mapped Input / Output...

![Memory Access Hook for Arm64 Emulation](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/unicorn-code2.png)

[_Memory Access Hook for Arm64 Emulation_](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/3655ac2875664376f42ad3a3ced5cbf067790782/src/main.rs#L59-L95)

# Memory Access Hook

To emulate our gadget (like PinePhone), we need to handle [__Memory-Mapped Input / Output__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O).

(Like for printing to the Serial or UART Port)

We do this in Unicorn Emulator with a __Memory Access Hook__ that will be called to __intercept every Memory Access__.

Here's a sample __Hook Function__ that will be called to intercept every Arm64 Read / Write Access: [main.rs](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/3655ac2875664376f42ad3a3ced5cbf067790782/src/main.rs#L83-L95)

```rust
// Hook Function for Memory Access.
// Called once for every Arm64 Memory Access.
fn hook_memory(
  _: &mut Unicorn<()>,  // Emulator
  mem_type: MemType,    // Read or Write Access
  address:  u64,    // Accessed Address
  size:     usize,  // Number of bytes accessed
  value:    i64     // Write Value
) -> bool {         // Always return true

  // TODO: Emulate Memory-Mapped Input/Output (UART Controller)
  println!("hook_memory: mem_type={:?}, address={:#x}, size={:?}, value={:#x}", mem_type, address, size, value);

  // Always return true, value is unused by caller
  // https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/blob/dev/docs/FAQ.md#i-cant-recover-from-unmapped-readwrite-even-i-return-true-in-the-hook-why
  true
}
```

Our Hook Function prints __every Read / Write Access__ to the Emulated Arm64 Memory.

This is how we __attach the Memory Hook Function__ to Unicorn Emulator: [main.rs](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/3655ac2875664376f42ad3a3ced5cbf067790782/src/main.rs#L59-L74)

```rust
// Add Hook for Arm64 Memory Access
let _ = emu.add_mem_hook(
  HookType::MEM_ALL,  // Intercept Read and Write Access
  0,           // Begin Address
  u64::MAX,    // End Address
  hook_memory  // Hook Function
).expect("failed to add memory hook");
```

When we run this, we see the Read and Write Memory Accesses made by our [__Emulated Arm64 Code__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/unicorn#emulate-arm64-machine-code)...

```text
hook_memory: 
  mem_type=WRITE, 
  address=0x10008, 
  size=4, 
  value=0x12345678

hook_memory: 
  mem_type=READ, 
  address=0x10008, 
  size=1, 
  value=0x0
```

(Value is not relevant for Memory Reads)

Later we'll implement UART Output with a Memory Access Hook. But first we intercept some code...

![Code Execution Hook for Arm64 Emulation](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/unicorn-code3.png)

[_Code Execution Hook for Arm64 Emulation_](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/3655ac2875664376f42ad3a3ced5cbf067790782/src/main.rs#L108-L117)

# Code Execution Hook

_Can we intercept every Arm64 Instruction that will be emulated?_

Yep we can attach a __Code Execution Hook__ to Unicorn Emulator.

Here's a sample Hook Function that will be called for __every Arm64 Instruction emulated__: [main.rs](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/3655ac2875664376f42ad3a3ced5cbf067790782/src/main.rs#L108-L117)

```rust
// Hook Function for Code Emulation.
// Called once for each Arm64 Instruction.
fn hook_code(
  _: &mut Unicorn<()>,  // Emulator
  address: u64,  // Instruction Address
  size: u32      // Instruction Size
) {
  // TODO: Handle special Arm64 Instructions
  println!("hook_code: address={:#x}, size={:?}", address, size);
}
```

And this is how we call Unicorn Emulator to __attach the Code Hook Function__: [main.rs](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/3655ac2875664376f42ad3a3ced5cbf067790782/src/main.rs#L52-L57)

```rust
// Add Hook for emulating each Arm64 Instruction
let _ = emu.add_code_hook(
  ADDRESS,  // Begin Address
  ADDRESS + arm64_code.len() as u64,  // End Address
  hook_code  // Hook Function for Code Emulation
).expect("failed to add code hook");
```

When we run this with our [__Arm64 Machine Code__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/unicorn#emulate-arm64-machine-code), we see the Address of __every Arm64 Instruction emulated__ (and its size)...

```text
hook_code:
  address=0x10000,
  size=4

hook_code:
  address=0x10004,
  size=4
```

We might use this to emulate [__Special Arm64 Instructions__](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102374/0101/Registers-in-AArch64---system-registers).

If we don't need to intercept every single instruction, try the Block Execution Hook...

# Block Execution Hook

_Is there something that works like a Code Execution Hook..._

_But doesn't stop at every single Arm64 Instruction?_

Yep Unicorn Emulator supports __Block Execution Hooks__.

This Hook Function will be called once when executing a __Block of Arm64 Instructions__: [main.rs](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/3655ac2875664376f42ad3a3ced5cbf067790782/src/main.rs#L97-L106)

```rust
// Hook Function for Block Emulation.
// Called once for each Basic Block of Arm64 Instructions.
fn hook_block(
  _: &mut Unicorn<()>,  // Emulator
  address: u64,  // Block Address
  size: u32      // Block Size
) {
  // TODO: Trace the flow of emulated code
  println!("hook_block: address={:#x}, size={:?}", address, size);
}
```

This is how we __attach the Block Execution Hook__: [main.rs](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/3655ac2875664376f42ad3a3ced5cbf067790782/src/main.rs#L48-L50)

```rust
// Add Hook for emulating each Basic Block of Arm64 Instructions
let _ = emu.add_block_hook(hook_block)
  .expect("failed to add block hook");
```

Block Execution Hooks are __less granular__ (called less often) than Code Execution Hooks...

```text
hook_block: address=0x10000, size=8
hook_code:  address=0x10000, size=4
hook_code:  address=0x10004, size=4
```

Which means that Unicorn Emulator calls our Hook Function only once for the [__entire Block of two Arm64 Instructions__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/unicorn#emulate-arm64-machine-code).

[(What's a Block of Arm64 Instructions?)](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator#what-is-a-block-of-arm64-instructions)

_How is this useful?_

This Block Execution Hook will be super helpful for monitoring the __Execution Flow__ of our emulated code.

Someday we might read the ELF Symbol Table (from the NuttX Image), match with the Block Execution Addresses...

And print the __name of the function__ that's being emulated!

# Unmapped Memory

_What happens when Unicorn Emulator tries to access memory that isn't mapped?_

Unicorn Emulator will call our Memory Access Hook with __mem_type__ set to __READ_UNMAPPED__...

```text
hook_memory:
  address=0x01c28014,
  size=2,
  mem_type=READ_UNMAPPED,
  value=0x0
```

[(Source)](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/b842358ba457b67ffa9f4c1a362b0386cfd97c4a/README.md#block-execution-hooks-for-arm64-emulation)

The log above says that address `01C2` `8014` is unmapped.

This is how we map the memory: [rust.rs](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/cd030954c2ace4cf0207872f275abc3ffb7343c6/src/main.rs#L26-L32)

```rust
// Map 16 MB at 0x0100 0000 for Memory-Mapped I/O by Allwinner A64 Peripherals
// https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/a64/hardware/a64_memorymap.h#L33-L51
emu.mem_map(
  0x0100_0000,       // Address
  16 * 1024 * 1024,  // Size
  Permission::READ | Permission::WRITE  // Read and Write Access
).expect("failed to map memory mapped I/O");
```

We'll see this later when we handle Memory-Mapped Input / Output.

_Can we map Memory Regions during emulation?_

Yep we may use a Memory Access Hook to __map memory regions on the fly__.

[(Like this)](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/blob/dev/docs/FAQ.md#i-cant-recover-from-unmapped-readwrite-even-i-return-true-in-the-hook-why)

![Running Apache NuttX RTOS in Unicorn](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/unicorn-code4.png)

[_Running Apache NuttX RTOS in Unicorn_](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/aa24d1c61256f38f92cf627d52c3e9a0c189bfc6/src/main.rs#L6-L78)

# Apache NuttX RTOS in Unicorn

We're ready to run Apache NuttX RTOS in Unicorn Emulator!

We've compiled [__Apache NuttX RTOS for PinePhone__](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/main/nuttx) into an Arm64 Binary Image: [__nuttx.bin__](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/main/nuttx/nuttx.bin)

This is how we __load the NuttX Binary Image__ into Unicorn: [main.rs](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/aa24d1c61256f38f92cf627d52c3e9a0c189bfc6/src/main.rs#L6-L40)

```rust
// Arm64 Memory Address where emulation starts
const ADDRESS: u64 = 0x4008_0000;

// Arm64 Machine Code for the above address
let arm64_code = include_bytes!("../nuttx/nuttx.bin");
```

[_(Rustle... Whoosh!)_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_bytes.html)

We __initialise the emulator__ the same way...

```rust
// Init Emulator in Arm64 mode
let mut unicorn = Unicorn::new(
  Arch::ARM64,
  Mode::LITTLE_ENDIAN
).expect("failed to init Unicorn");

// Magical horse mutates to bird
let emu = &mut unicorn;
```

Based on the [__NuttX Memory Map__](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/include/a64/chip.h#L44-L52) for PinePhone, we map two Memory Regions for NuttX...

-   __Executable Memory__ (128 MB) at __`4000` `0000`__

    (For Arm64 Machine Code, Data and BSS)

-   __Read / Write Memory__ (512 MB) at __`0000` `0000`__

    (For Memory-Mapped I/O by Allwinner A64 Peripherals)

```rust
// Map 128 MB Executable Memory at 0x4000 0000 for Arm64 Machine Code
// https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/include/a64/chip.h#L44-L52
emu.mem_map(
  0x4000_0000,        // Address
  128 * 1024 * 1024,  // Size
  Permission::ALL     // Read, Write and Execute Access
).expect("failed to map code page");

// Map 512 MB Read/Write Memory at 0x0000 0000 for
// Memory-Mapped I/O by Allwinner A64 Peripherals
// https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/include/a64/chip.h#L44-L52
emu.mem_map(
  0x0000_0000,        // Address
  512 * 1024 * 1024,  // Size
  Permission::READ | Permission::WRITE  // Read and Write Access
).expect("failed to map memory mapped I/O");
```

We __load the NuttX Machine Code__ into Emulated Memory...

```rust
// Write Arm64 Machine Code to emulated Executable Memory
emu.mem_write(
  ADDRESS,    // Address is 4008 0000
  arm64_code  // NuttX Binary Image
).expect("failed to write instructions");
```

And we __run NuttX RTOS__!

```rust
// Omitted: Attach Code, Block and Memory Hooks
...
// Emulate Arm64 Machine Code
let err = emu.emu_start(
  ADDRESS,  // Begin Address
  ADDRESS + arm64_code.len() as u64,  // End Address
  0,  // No Timeout
  0   // Unlimited number of instructions
);
```

Unicorn happily __boots Nuttx RTOS__ (yay!)...

See the pattern? Unicorn Emulator loops forever at address __`4008` `01F4`__...

While reading the data from address __`01C2` `8014`__.

_What's at 4008 01F4?_

Here's the __NuttX Arm64 Disassembly__ at address __`4008` `01F4`__: [nuttx.S](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/a1fb82d829856d86d6845c477709c2be24373aca/nuttx/nuttx.S#L3398-L3411)

  b.eq  1b                /* Wait for the UART to be ready (THRE=1) */
.endm
```

_NuttX is printing something to the UART Port?_

Yep! NuttX prints __Debug Messages__ to the (Serial) UART Port when it boots...

And it's waiting for the __UART Controller to be ready__, before printing!

[(As explained here)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/uboot#wait-for-uart-ready)

_What's at 01C2 8014?_

__`01C2` `8014`__ is the __UART Line Status Register__ (UART_LSR) for the Allwinner A64 UART Controller inside PinePhone.

__Bit 5__ needs to be set to 1 to indicate that the __UART Transmit FIFO__ is ready. Or NuttX will wait forever!

[(As explained here)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/serial#wait-to-transmit)

_How to fix the UART Ready Bit at 01C2 8014?_

This is how we __emulate the UART Ready Bit__ with our Input / Output Memory: [main.rs](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-emulator/blob/4d78876ad6f40126bf68cb2da4a43f56d9ef6e76/src/main.rs#L42-L49)

```rust
// Allwinner A64 UART Line Status Register (UART_LSR) at Offset 0x14.
// To indicate that the UART Transmit FIFO is ready:
// Set Bit 5 to 1.
// https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/serial#wait-to-transmit
emu.mem_write(
  0x01c2_8014,  // UART Register Address
  &[0b10_0000]  // UART Register Value
).expect("failed to set UART_LSR");
```

And Unicorn Emulator stops looping!

Unicorn continues booting NuttX, which fills the [__BSS Section__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.bss) with 0...

But we don't see any NuttX Boot Messages. Let's print the UART Output...

# Emulate UART Output

TODO

_We expect to see the Boot Messages from NuttX..._

_How do we print the UART Output?_

According to the Allwinner A64 Doc...

-   ["Transmit UART"](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/serial#transmit-uart)

NuttX RTOS will write the UART Output to the UART Transmit Holding Register (THR) at `0x01c2` `8000`.

In our Memory Access Hook, let's intercept all writes to `0x01c2` `8000` and dump the characters written to UART Output...

```rust
// Hook Function for Memory Access.
// Called once for every Arm64 Memory Access.
fn hook_memory(
    _: &mut Unicorn<()>,  // Emulator
    mem_type: MemType,    // Read or Write Access
    address: u64,  // Accessed Address
    size: usize,   // Number of bytes accessed
    value: i64     // Write Value
) -> bool {
    // Ignore RAM access, we only intercept Memory-Mapped Input / Output
    if address >= 0x4000_0000 { return true; }
    println!("hook_memory: address={:#010x}, size={:?}, mem_type={:?}, value={:#x}", address, size, mem_type, value);

    // If writing to UART Transmit Holding Register (THR):
    // Print the output
    // https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/serial#transmit-uart
    if address == 0x01c2_8000 {
        println!("uart output: {:?}", value as u8 as char);
    }

    // Always return true, value is unused by caller
    true
}
```

When we run this, we see a long chain of UART Output...

```text
‚Üí cargo run | grep uart
uart output: '-'
uart output: ' '
uart output: 'R'
uart output: 'e'
uart output: 'a'
uart output: 'd'
uart output: 'y'
...
```

[(Source)](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/587dbeb9329d9755e4d007dd8e1246cd)

Which reads as...

```text
- Ready to Boot CPU
- Boot from EL2
- Boot from EL1
- Boot to C runtime for OS Initialize
```

Yep NuttX RTOS is booting on Unicorn Emulator! But Unicorn Emulator halts while booting NuttX...

Unicorn Emulator halts at the NuttX MMU (EL1) code at `0x4008` `0ef8`...

```text

Unicorn Emulator triggers the exception when NuttX writes to SCTLR_EL1...

```c
  /* Enable the MMU and data cache */
  value = read_sysreg(sctlr_el1);
  write_sysreg((value | SCTLR_M_BIT | SCTLR_C_BIT), sctlr_el1);
```

[(Source)](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/arch/arm64/src/common/arm64_mmu.c#L541-L544)

_Why the MMU Fault?_

The above code sets these flags in SCTLR_EL1 (System Control Register EL1)...

- SCTLR_M_BIT (Bit 0): Enable Address Translation for EL0 and EL1 Stage 1

- SCTLR_C_BIT (Bit 2): Enable Caching for EL0 and EL1 Stage 1

[(More about SCTLR_EL1)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0595/2021-06/AArch64-Registers/SCTLR-EL1--System-Control-Register--EL1-)

TODO: Why did the Address Translation (or Caching) fail?

TODO: Should we skip the MMU Update to SCTLR_EL1? Since we don't use MMU?

# Emulation Concerns

_So are we happy with Unicorn Emulator?_

Yep! Unicorn Emulator is sufficient for __Automated Daily Build and Test__ for NuttX on PinePhone. (Via GitHub Actions)

Which will be similar to this BL602 setup, but we'll boot the Daily Build on Unicorn Emulator (instead of Real Hardware)...

-   [__"Auto Flash and Test NuttX on RISC-V BL602"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/auto)

_But our PinePhone Emulator doesn't handle Console Input..._

Yeah we'll do that later. We have a long wishlist of features to build: Interrupts, Memory Protection, Multiple CPUs, Cortex A53, GIC v2, ...
