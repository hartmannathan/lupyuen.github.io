# (Possibly) Emulate PinePhone with Unicorn Emulator

üìù _1 Mar 2023_

![TODO](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/unicorn-title.jpg)

We're porting a new operating system ([__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/what)) to [__Pine64 PinePhone__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone). And I wondered...

_To make PinePhone testing easier..._

_Can we emulate Arm64 PinePhone with [Unicorn Emulator](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/)?_

Let's find out! We'll call the [__Unicorn Emulator__](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/) in Rust (instead of C).

(Because I'm too old to write meticulous C... But I'm OK to get nagged by Rust Compiler if I miss something!)

We begin by emulating simple Arm64 Machine Code...
