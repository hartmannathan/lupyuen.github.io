# Fixed the UART Interrupt and Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (Ox64 BL808)

üìù _20 Dec 2023_

![UART Input and Platform-Level Interrupt Controller are finally OK on Apache NuttX RTOS and Ox64 BL808 RISC-V SBC!](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/plic3-title.png)

Last week we walked through the __Serial Console__ for [__Pine64 Ox64 BL808__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Ox64) 64-bit RISC-V Single-Board Computer (pic below)...

-   [__"UART Interrupt and Platform-Level Interrupt Controller"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2)

And we hit some illogical impossible problems on [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/ox2) (Real-Time Operating System)...

- [__Console Input__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#backup-plan) is always empty

  (Can't enter any Console Commands)

- [__Interrupt Claim__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#more-trouble-with-interrupt-claim) is forever 0

  (Ox64 won't tell us which Interrupt was fired!)

- [__Leaky Writes__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#trouble-with-interrupt-priority) are mushing up adjacent Interrupt Registers

  (Or maybe Leaky Reads?)

Today we discover the __One Single Culprit__ behind all this rowdy mischief...

__Weak Ordering in the MMU__! (Memory Management Unit)

Here's how we solved the baffling mystery...

![Pine64 Ox64 64-bit RISC-V SBC (Sorry for my substandard soldering)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/ox64-solder.jpg)

# UART Interrupt

_Sorry TLDR: What's this PLIC? What's Serial Console gotta do with it?_

[__Platform-Level Interrupt Controller__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#platform-level-interrupt-controller) (PLIC) is the hardware inside our BL808 SoC that controls the forwarding of __Peripheral Interrupts__ to our 64-bit RISC-V CPU.

(Like the Interrupts for __UART__, __I2C__, __SPI__, ...)

![BL808 Platform-Level Interrupt Controller](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/plic2-bl808a.jpg)

_Why should we bother with PLIC?_

Suppose we're using the __Serial Console__ on Ox64 SBC (pic above)...

- Every single __key that we press__...

- Is received by the __UART Controller__ in our RISC-V SoC...

  (Bouffalo Lab BL808 SoC)

- Which fires an __Interrupt through the PLIC__ to the RISC-V CPU 

  (T-Head C906 RISC-V Core)

Without the PLIC, it's __impossible to enter commands__ in the Serial Console!

_Tell me more..._

Let's run through the steps to __handle a UART Interrupt__ on a RISC-V SBC... 

![Platform-Level Interrupt Controller for Pine64 Ox64 64-bit RISC-V SBC (Bouffalo Lab BL808)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/plic2-registers.jpg)

1.  At Startup, we set the [__Interrupt Priority__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#set-the-interrupt-priority) to 1

    (Lowest Priority)

1.  And [__Interrupt Threshold__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#set-the-interrupt-threshold) to 0.

    (Allow all Interrupts to fire later)

1.  We flip Bit 20 of [__Interrupt Enable__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#enable-the-interrupt) Register to 1.

    (To enable __RISC-V IRQ 20__ for UART3)

1.  Suppose we __press a key__ on the Serial Console.

    Our SoC will __fire an Interrupt__ for IRQ 20.

    (IRQ means __Interrupt Request Number__)

1.  Our Interrupt Handler will read the Interrupt Number (20) from the [__Interrupt Claim__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#claim-the-interrupt) Register...

    Call the [__UART Driver__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#appendix-uart-driver-for-ox64) to read the keypress...

    Then write 20 back into the same old [__Interrupt Claim__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#claim-the-interrupt) Register...

    Which will __Complete the Interrupt__.

1.  Useful But Non-Essential: [__Interrupt Pending__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#pending-interrupts) Register says which Interrupts are awaiting Claiming and Completion.

    (We'll use it for troubleshooting)

That's the Textbook Recipe for PLIC, according to the [__Official RISC-V PLIC Spec__](https://five-embeddev.com/riscv-isa-manual/latest/plic.html#plic). (If Julia Child wrote a PLIC Textbook)

But it doesn't work on Ox64 BL808 SBC and T-Head C906 Core...

TODO: Trouble pic

# UART and PLIC Troubles

_What happens when we run the PLIC Recipe on Ox64?_

Absolute Disaster! (Pic above)

- [__Interrupt Priorities__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#trouble-with-interrupt-priority) all get mushed up to 0

- When we set the [__Interrupt Enable__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#trouble-with-interrupt-priority) Register...

  The value gets __leaked over__ into the next 32-bit word

  (Hence the __"Leaky Write"__)

- [__Interrupt Claim__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#more-trouble-with-interrupt-claim) Register is always 0

  (Can't read the __Actual Interrupt Number__!)

- Our [__UART Driver__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#backup-plan) says that the UART Input is Empty!

Our troubles are all Seemingly Unrelated. However there's actually only One Sinister Culprit causing all these headaches...

# Leaky Reads in UART

_How do we track down the culprit?_

We begin with the simplest bug: [__UART Input__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/plic2#backup-plan) is always Empty.

This is how we read the __UART Input__: [bl602_serial.c](https://github.com/lupyuen2/wip-pinephone-nuttx/blob/ox64c/arch/risc-v/src/jh7110/bl602_serial.c#L943-L995)

```c
// Receive one character from the UART Port.
// Called (indirectly) by the UART Interrupt Handler: __uart_interrupt
int bl602_receive(...) {
  ...
  // If there's Pending UART Input...
  // (FIFO_CONFIG_1 is 0x30002084)
  if (getreg32(BL602_UART_FIFO_CONFIG_1(uart_idx)) & UART_FIFO_CONFIG_1_RX_CNT_MASK) {

    // Then read the Actual UART Input
    // (FIFO_RDATA is 0x3000208c)
    rxdata = getreg32(BL602_UART_FIFO_RDATA(uart_idx)) & UART_FIFO_RDATA_MASK;
```

Which says that we...

- Check if there's any __Pending UART Input__...

  (At address `0x3000_2084`)

- Before reading the __Actual UART Input__

  (At address `0x3000_208C`)

Or simply...

```c
// Check for Pending UART Input
uintptr_t pending = getreg32(0x30002084);

// Read the Actual UART Input
uintptr_t rx = getreg32(0x3000208c);

// Dump the values
_info("pending=%p, rx=%p\n", pending, rx);
```

_What happens when we run this?_

Something strange happens...

```text
// Yep there's Pending UART Input...
pending=0x7070120

// But Actual UART Input is empty!
rx=0
```

UART Controller says there's __UART Input to be read__... And it's __totally empty__!

_How is that possible?_

The only logical explanation: Someone has __already read__ the UART Input!

UART Input gets __Auto-Reset to 0__, right after it's read. Someone must have read it, unintentionally.

_Hmmm this sounds like a Leaky Read..._

Exactly! (Pic below)

- When we check if there's any __Pending UART Input__...

  (At address `0x3000_2084`)

- It causes the neighbouring __Actual UART Input__ to be read unintentionally...

  (At address `0x3000_208C`)

- Which auto-erases the __Actual UART Input__...

  Before we actually read it!

Yep we indeed have a Leaky Read + Leaky Write that's causing all our UART + PLIC worries. Why oh why?

# T-Head Errata

_But Linux runs OK on Ox64 BL808..._

_Something special about Linux on T-Head C906?_

We search for __"T-Head"__ in the [__Linux Kernel Repo__](https://github.com/torvalds/linux). And we see this vital clue: [errata_list.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/riscv/include/asm/errata_list.h#L69-L164)

```c
// T-Head Errata for Linux
#ifdef CONFIG_ERRATA_THEAD_PBMT
  // IO/NOCACHE memory types are handled together with svpbmt,
  // so on T-Head chips, check if no other memory type is set,
  // and set the non-0 PMA type if applicable.
  ...
  asm volatile(... _PAGE_MTMASK_THEAD ...)
```

[(__Svpbmt Extension__ defines __Page-Based Memory Types__)](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/blob/main/src/supervisor.adoc#svpbmt)

_Aha! A Linux Errata for T-Head CPU!_

We track down __PAGE_MTMASK_THEAD__: [pgtable-64.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/riscv/include/asm/pgtable-64.h#L126-L142)

```c
// T-Head Memory Type Definitions in Linux
#define _PAGE_PMA_THEAD     ((1UL << 62) | (1UL << 61) | (1UL << 60))
#define _PAGE_NOCACHE_THEAD ((1UL < 61) | (1UL << 60))
#define _PAGE_IO_THEAD      ((1UL << 63) | (1UL << 60))
#define _PAGE_MTMASK_THEAD  (_PAGE_PMA_THEAD | _PAGE_IO_THEAD | (1UL << 59))
```

Which is annotated with...

```text
[63:59] T-Head Memory Type definitions:
Bit[63] SO  - Strong Order
Bit[62] C   - Cacheable
Bit[61] B   - Bufferable
Bit[60] SH  - Shareable
Bit[59] Sec - Trustable

00110 - NC:  Weakly-Ordered, Non-Cacheable, Bufferable, Shareable, Non-Trustable
01110 - PMA: Weakly-Ordered, Cacheable, Bufferable, Shareable, Non-Trustable
10010 - IO:  Strongly-Ordered, Non-Cacheable, Non-Bufferable, Shareable, Non-Trustable
```

[(Source)](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/riscv/include/asm/pgtable-64.h#L126-L142)

_Something special about I/O Memory?_

The last line suggests we need to configure the __T-Head Memory Type__ specifically to support __I/O Memory__ (PAGE_IO_THEAD)...

| Memory Attribute | Bit |
|:-----------------|:----|
| __Strongly-Ordered__ | Bit 63 is 1 |
| __Non-Cacheable__ | Bit 62 is 0 _(Default)_ |
| __Non-Bufferable__ | Bit 61 is 0 _(Default)_ |
| __Shareable__ | Bit 60 is 1 |
| __Non-Trustable__ | Bit 59 is 0 _(Default)_ |

We deduce that __"Strong Order"__ is the Magical Bit that we need for UART and PLIC!

_What's "Strong Order"_

[__"Strong Order"__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_ordering#Runtime_memory_ordering) means "All Reads and All Writes are In-Order".

Apparently T-Head C906 will (by default) __Disable Strong Order__, to read and write memory __Out-of-Sequence__. (So that it performs better)

Which will surely mess up our UART and PLIC Registers!

[(What's __"Shareable"__? It's not documented)](https://github.com/T-head-Semi/openc906/blob/main/C906_RTL_FACTORY/gen_rtl/mmu/rtl/aq_mmu_regs.v#L341-L342)

_How to enable Strong Order?_

We do it in the T-Head C906 MMU...

![Level 1 Page Table for MMU](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/mmu-l1kernel2b.jpg)

[_Level 1 Page Table for MMU_](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/mmu#huge-chunks-level-1)

# Memory Management Unit

_Wow the soup gets too salty. What's MMU?_

[__Memory Management Unit (MMU)__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/mmu) is the hardware inside our SBC that does...

- __Memory Protection__: Prevent Applications (and Kernel) from meddling with things (in System Memory) that they're not supposed to

- __Virtual Memory__: Allow Applications to access chunks of "Imaginary Memory" at Exotic Addresses (__`0x8000_0000`__!)

  But in reality: They're System RAM recycled from boring old addresses (like __`0x5060_4000`__)

  (Kinda like "The Matrix")

For Ox64: We switched on the MMU to protect the Kernel Memory from the Apps. And to protect the Apps from each other.

_How does it work?_

The pic above shows the __Level 1 Page Table__ that we configured in our MMU. The Page Table has a __Page Table Entry__ that says...

- __V:__ It's a __Valid__ Page Table Entry

- __G:__ It's a [__Global Mapping__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/mmu#swap-the-satp-register)

- __R:__ Allow __Kernel Reads__ for __`0x0`__ to __`0x3FFF_FFFF`__

- __W:__ Allow __Kernel Writes__ for __`0x0`__ to __`0x3FFF_FFFF`__

  (Including the UART Registers at `0x3000_2000`)

Remember __PAGE_IO_THEAD__ and __Strong Order__?

| Memory Attribute | Bit |
|:-----------------|:----|
| __SO: Strongly-Ordered__ | Bit 63 is 1 |
| __SH: Shareable__ | Bit 60 is 1 |

We'll set the __SO and SH Bits__ in our Page Table Entries. Hopefully UART and PLIC won't get mushed up no more...

[(__Svpbmt Extension__ will support __Strong Ordering__)](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/blob/main/src/supervisor.adoc#svpbmt)

TODO: Strong Order Pic

# Enable Strong Order

_We need to set the Strong Order Bit..._

_How will we set it in our Page Table Entry?_

For testing, we patched our MMU Code to set the __Strong Order Bit__ in our Page Table Entries: [riscv_mmu.c](https://github.com/lupyuen2/wip-pinephone-nuttx/blob/ox64c/arch/risc-v/src/common/riscv_mmu.c#L100-L127)

```c
// Set a Page Table Entry in a Page Table for the MMU
void mmu_ln_setentry(
  uint32_t ptlevel,   // Level of Page Table: 1, 2 or 3 
  uintptr_t lntable,  // Page Table Address
  uintptr_t paddr,    // Physical Address
  uintptr_t vaddr,    // Virtual Address (For Kernel: Same as Physical Address)
  uint32_t mmuflags   // MMU Flags (V / G / R / W)
) {
  ...
  // Set the Page Table Entry:
  // Physical Page Number and MMU Flags (V / G / R / W)
  lntable[index] = (paddr | mmuflags);

  // Now we set the T-Head Memory Type in Bits 59 to 63.
  // For I/O and PLIC Memory, we set...
  // SO (Bit 63): Strong Order
  // SH (Bit 60): Shareable
  #define _PAGE_IO_THEAD ((1UL << 63) | (1UL << 60))

  // If this is a Leaf Page Table Entry
  // for I/O Memory or PLIC Memory...
  if ((mmuflags & PTE_R) &&    // Leaf Page Table Entry
    (vaddr < 0x40000000UL ||   // I/O Memory
    vaddr >= 0xe0000000UL)) {  // PLIC Memory

    // Then set the Strong Order
    // and Shareable Bits
    lntable[index] = lntable[index]
      | _PAGE_IO_THEAD;
  }
```

The code above will set the __Strong Order and Shareable Bits__ for...

- __I/O Memory__: __`0x0`__ to __`0x3FFF_FFFF`__

  (Including the UART Registers at `0x3000_2000`)

- __PLIC Memory__: __`0xE000_0000`__ to __`0xEFFF_FFFF`__

```text
map I/O regions
  vaddr=0, lntable[index]=0x90000000000000e7
  // "0x9000..." means Strong Order (Bit 63) and Shareable (Bit 60) are set

map PLIC as Interrupt L2
  vaddr=0xe0000000, lntable[index]=0x90000000380000e7
  vaddr=0xe0200000, lntable[index]=0x90000000380800e7
  vaddr=0xe0400000, lntable[index]=0x90000000381000e7

  // "0x9000..." means Strong Order (Bit 63) and Shareable (Bit 60) are set
```

We test our patched code...

Here are the differences (marked above)...

```text
Offset 20: uart_int_sts (Interrupt Status)

00000094 = 0b10010100
Bit 7 urx_fer_int: UART RX FIFO error interrupt, auto-cleared when FIFO overflow/underflow error flag is cleared
Bit 4 urx_rto_int: UART RX Time-out interrupt
Bit 2 utx_frdy_int: UART TX FIFO ready (tx_fifo_cnt > tx_fifo_th) interrupt, auto-cleared when data is pushed

00000012 = 0b00010010
Bit 4 urx_rto_int: UART RX Time-out interrupt
Bit 1 urx_end_int: UART RX transfer end interrupt (set according to cr_urx_-len)

Offset 24: uart_int_mask (Interrupt Mask)
00000ff5
00000fff
TODO: Set to 0xfff

Offset 50: urx_bcr_int_cfg (Receive Byte Count)
001cffff
0026ffff
Number of bytes received. OK to ignore this.

Offset 80: uart_fifo_config_0 (FIFO Config 0)
00000080
00000000
Bit 7 rx_fifo_underflow: Underflow flag of RX FIFO
Can be cleared by rx_fifo_clr.
TODO: Set Bit 3 rx_fifo_clr: Clear signal of RX FIFO

Offset 84: uart_fifo_config_1 (FIFO Config 1)
07070018
07070000
rx_fifo_cnt = 1 (RX FIFO available count)
tx_fifo_cnt = 8 (TX FIFO available count)
Let's ignore this.

Offset 8c: uart_fifo_rdata (Receive Data)
00000000
00000078
RX FIFO. OK to ignore this.
```

Nope still the same.

![UART Input and Platform-Level Interrupt Controller are finally OK on Apache NuttX RTOS and Ox64 BL808 RISC-V SBC!](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/plic3-title.png)

# Appendix: Build and Run NuttX

In this article, we ran a Work-In-Progress Version of __Apache NuttX RTOS for Ox64__, with PLIC and Console Input working OK.

This is how we download and build NuttX for Ox64 BL808 SBC...

```bash
## Download the WIP NuttX Source Code
git clone \
  --branch ox64c \
  https://github.com/lupyuen2/wip-pinephone-nuttx \
  nuttx
git clone \
  --branch ox64c \
  https://github.com/lupyuen2/wip-pinephone-nuttx-apps \
  apps

## Build NuttX
cd nuttx
tools/configure.sh star64:nsh
make

## Export the NuttX Kernel
## to `nuttx.bin`
riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy \
  -O binary \
  nuttx \
  nuttx.bin

## Dump the disassembly to nuttx.S
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump \
  --syms --source --reloc --demangle --line-numbers --wide \
  --debugging \
  nuttx \
  >nuttx.S \
  2>&1
```

[(Remember to install the __Build Prerequisites and Toolchain__)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/release#build-nuttx-for-star64)

Then we build the __Initial RAM Disk__ that contains NuttX Shell and NuttX Apps...

```bash
## Build the Apps Filesystem
make -j 8 export
pushd ../apps
./tools/mkimport.sh -z -x ../nuttx/nuttx-export-*.tar.gz
make -j 8 import
popd

## Generate the Initial RAM Disk `initrd`
## in ROMFS Filesystem Format
## from the Apps Filesystem `../apps/bin`
## and label it `NuttXBootVol`
genromfs \
  -f initrd \
  -d ../apps/bin \
  -V "NuttXBootVol"

## Prepare a Padding with 64 KB of zeroes
head -c 65536 /dev/zero >/tmp/nuttx.zero

## Append Padding and Initial RAM Disk to NuttX Kernel
cat nuttx.bin /tmp/nuttx.zero initrd \
  >Image
```

TODO: [(See the __Build Outputs__)](https://github.com/lupyuen2/wip-pinephone-nuttx/releases/tag/ox64b-1)

[(Why the __64 KB Padding__)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/app#pad-the-initial-ram-disk)

Next we prepare a __Linux microSD__ for Ox64 as described [__in the previous article__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/ox64).

[(Remember to flash __OpenSBI and U-Boot Bootloader__)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/ox64#flash-opensbi-and-u-boot)

Then we do the [__Linux-To-NuttX Switcheroo__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/ox64#apache-nuttx-rtos-for-ox64): Overwrite the microSD Linux Image by the __NuttX Kernel__...

```bash
## Overwrite the Linux Image
## on Ox64 microSD
cp Image \
  "/Volumes/NO NAME/Image"
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2
```

Insert the [__microSD into Ox64__](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/ox64-sd.jpg) and power up Ox64.

Ox64 boots [__OpenSBI__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/sbi), which starts [__U-Boot Bootloader__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/linux#u-boot-bootloader-for-star64), which starts __NuttX Kernel__ and the NuttX Shell (NSH).

_What happens when we press a key?_

NuttX will respond to our keypress. (Because we configured the PLIC)

But the UART Input reads as null right now. (Pic above)
