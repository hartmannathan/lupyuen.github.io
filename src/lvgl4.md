# NuttX RTOS for PinePhone: Feature Phone UI in LVGL, Zig and WebAssembly

üìù _12 Jun 2023_

![TODO](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/lvgl4-title.jpg)

This article explains how we created an [__LVGL Graphical App__](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/index.html) for [__Pine64 PinePhone__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone)... By tweaking and testing in a __Web Browser!__

(Plus a little [__Zig Programming__](https://ziglang.org))

TODO: Web Browser?

TODO: Zig?

TODO: PinePhone?

is a popular __Graphics Library__ for Microcontrollers. (In C)

[__Zig Compiler__](https://ziglang.org/) works great for compiling __C Libraries into WebAssembly__. (Based on Clang Compiler)

Right now we're creating a [__Feature Phone UI__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/usb2#pinephone--nuttx--feature-phone) (in Zig) for [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/what) (Real-Time Operating System)

# What's Next

TODO

We'll experiment with __Live Reloading__: Whenever we save our Zig LVGL App, it __auto-recompiles__ and __auto-reloads__ the WebAssembly HTML.

Which makes UI Prototyping a lot quicker in LVGL. Stay Tuned for updates!
