Last week we ran [__Apache NuttX Real-Time Operating System__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/what) (RTOS) on [__Unicorn Emulator__](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/)...

-   [__"(Possibly) Emulate PinePhone with Unicorn Emulator"__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/unicorn)

And we hit an __Arm64 Exception__ in the (Emulated) __Memory Management Unit__.

# What's Next

This has been a fun educational exercise. Now we have a way to run __Automated Daily Tests__ for Apache NuttX RTOS on PinePhone... Kudos to the __Maintainers of Unicorn Emulator__!

Many Thanks to my [__GitHub Sponsors__](https://github.com/sponsors/lupyuen) for supporting my work! This article wouldn't have been possible without your support.
