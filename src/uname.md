# What's Next

Next Article: Why __Sync-Build-Ingest__ is super important for NuttX CI. And how we monitor it with our __Magic Disco Light__.

After That: Since we can __Rewind NuttX Builds__ and automatically __Git Bisect__... Can we create a Bot that will fetch the __Failed Builds from NuttX Dashboard__, identify the Breaking PR, and escalate to the right folks?

Many Thanks to the awesome __NuttX Admins__ and __NuttX Devs__! And [__My Sponsors__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/sponsor), for sticking with me all these years.
