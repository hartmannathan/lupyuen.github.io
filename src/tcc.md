# TCC RISC-V Compiler runs in the Web Browser (thanks to Zig Compiler)

_TCC is a Tiny C Compiler for 64-bit RISC-V... Can we run TCC in a Web Browser?_

Let's find out! We'll compile TCC to WebAssembly with Zig Compiler.

TODO: Interesting challenges

_Why are we doing this?_

Today we can run [__Apache NuttX RTOS in a Web Browser__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/tinyemu2) (with WebAssembly + Emscripten + 64-bit RISC-V).

What if we could allow NuttX Apps to be compiled and tested in the Web Browser?

1.  We type a C Program into a HTML Textbox...

    ```c
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
      printf("Hello, World!!\n");
      return 0;
    }
    ```

1.  Run TCC in the Web Browser to compile the C Program into an ELF Executable (64-bit RISC-V)

1.  Copy the ELF Executable to the NuttX Filesystem (via WebAssembly)

1.  NuttX runs our ELF Executable inside the Web Browser
