# (Possibly) LVGL in WebAssembly with Zig Compiler

[__LVGL__](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/index.html) is a popular __Graphics Library__ for Microcontrollers. (In C)

[__Zig Compiler__](https://ziglang.org/) works great for compiling __C Libraries into WebAssembly__. (Based on Clang)

Can we preview an __LVGL App in the Web Browser__... With WebAssembly and Zig Compiler? Let's find out!

_Why are we doing this?_

Right now we're creating a [__Feature Phone UI__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/usb2#pinephone--nuttx--feature-phone) (in Zig) for [__Apache NuttX RTOS__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/what) (Real-Time Operating System) on [__Pine64 PinePhone__](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone).

Would be awesome if we could prototype the Feature Phone UI in our Web Browser... To make the __UI Coding a little easier__!

_Doesn't LVGL support WebAssembly already?_

Today LVGL runs in a Web Browser by compiling with [__Emscripten and SDL__](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_web_emscripten).

Maybe we can do better with newer tools like __Zig Compiler__? In this article we'll...

-   Compile __LVGL Library from C to WebAssembly__ (with Zig Compiler)

-   Test it with an __LVGL App__ (in Zig)

-   How we made it work for rendering __Simple UIs__

-   What's next for rendering __UI Controls__
