[__Pine64 Star64__](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/STAR64) is a new 64-bit RISC-V Single-Board Computer, based on the [__StarFive JH7110__](https://doc-en.rvspace.org/Doc_Center/jh7110.html) SoC.

_What's NuttX?_

[__Apache NuttX__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/riscv) is a __Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)__ that runs on many kinds of devices, from 8-bit to 64-bit.

The analysis that we do today will be super helpful for [__porting NuttX to Star64__](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/riscv#jump-to-start).
